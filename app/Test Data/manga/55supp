      "synopsis": "For Mikan, there was no better friend than Hotaru (though Hotaru sometimes seems to have other sentiments). They often played together. But Hotaru is a very special child, and she agrees to go to a school in Tokyo which the government reserved only for geniuses. This left a very lonely Mikan at home. When Hotaru fails to keep her promise and come home for holidays, her young friend is very disappointed and rather angry. But upon overhearing a conversation between Hotaru's mother and a teacher, Mikan realizes that her friend's reasons for leaving might not have been what they seemed. So Mikan takes it upon herself to run away and go to Hotaru's school. There she discovers the so-called \"genius academy\" is actually a school for people gifted with special powers called \"alices.\" Her friend Hotaru is one of these, and after a chance encounter with a teacher, Mikan suddenly finds herself enrolled. Finally, the two friends are reunited, but is Mikan actually one of those so-called Alices? (Source: Aerie Scans)",

Hated and feared by a lot of students at the academy because of his dangerous Alice and cold attitude. Due to the isolation he feels from most of his classmates and hatred many student feel about him he is often bullied even though he comes to ignore it, although the class he is a part of holds him in very high regard and often follows his orders. \n \n He is thoroughly unhappy with the school and is always suspicious of the intentions of adults because he believes that they use their power over the younger students to hurt and abuse. He is involved in top-secret missions for the Academy which are shady and haven't quite been explained in the story yet, although he often returns injured. \n \n He is paired up as Mikan's partner in class by the their mostly-absent class teacher, Narumi. Although at first he rebels strongly against this duty, he later accepts it and begins to enjoy Mikan's company, along with the company of his classmates and finds himself getting friendlier as the series progresses, although he never quite loses his dangerous edge and temper. \n \n He possesses the fire Alice. It is revealed early on that since Natsume has such a powerful Alice, it causes a lot of stress on his body to use and shortens his lifespan immensely. He had been showing the symptoms of a life shortening Alice for a year before the start of the series and had been progressing quickly due to the constant use of his abilities for missions for the Academy. Because of this, he can be seen quite a few times through the manga coughing blood or even going unconcious.\n \n The story for Natsume entering the Academy was the rumor that he was a murderer and once set fire to a village. However, it turns out that his younger sister Aoi lost control of her Alice and accidentally set the buildings ablaze, losing her Alice, memories and her sight in the process. Aoi is used as a hostage to get Natsume to cooperate when he gets testy, and even after Aoi is released, he continues to perform his missions to keep Mikan and Ruka safe. \n \n He has a close group of friends, which at first is only Ruka, the only person at the Academy who understands his reasons for being there and originally agreed to come to the Academy because of Natsume. Later, though, he grows deeply fond of Mikan and finds himself trying to protect her from the dark side of the Academy. He gets extremely jealous whenever if Narumi, Tsubasa or any other male character gets too close with her, something that is often used against him by the older boys for teasing. He's often seen kicking the older guys shins, holding Mikan back from hugging others or burning the tips of Mikan's hair to get her attention again.\n \n He is the only Special Star in the Elementary Division, thus entitling him to a lot of luxurious things that he never really gets to take advantage of.\n \n In chapter 50, he kisses Mikan during the Christmas party, to which their relationship develops. In the most recent chapters, he searches relentlessly to find Mikan since she was taken away by the Academy for her Alice and when he finally finds her, he manages to get her to confess as a 'reward' for tracking her down. He does confess in return.\n In the epilogue, it shows that Mikan and Natsume continue their relationship and get married.\n\n",

She is a cute, energetic, good-natured girl, but her clumsiness lands her into trouble. She is a very up-an-at-it  and athletic person, much to annoyance of her down-to-earth friend, Hotaru. She used to live with her grandfather in the countryside. \n \n She was shocked to hear that Hotaru was moving back to the city to go to an academy for young 'geniuses' like her. When she heard rumors that students were like slaves in Alice Academy (which she felt was a possibility, since they gave money to parents for sending their children to the school), Mikan left her grandfather and her home to go after Hotaru by herself. She was then accepted to Alice Academy by Narumi-sensei and could attend Alice Academy with Hotaru and many other children with extraordinary powers.\n \n Her Alice is Nullification, which can resist the effect of Pheromone type Alices and completely negate the powers of other Alices in close proximity to her. She also possesses the Stealing Alice that can steal alices and turn them into colored rocks, which she inherited from her mother. Both of her Alices are very rare and special.\n \n She once belonged to the Special Ability Class. Later, she gets transferred to the Dangerous Ability Class, and becomes the Elementary Principal's precious favorite. She is currently a Single Star, but it's most likely changed to Special Star due to the fact she is highly favored by the principal.\n \n Throughout the story, she has a lot of effect on Natsume and Ruka, who have both started to fall in love with her. As the story progresses she becomes liked and admired by a lot of the people that used to feel uneasy about her Alice. Even her relationship with Hotaru grows stronger. Her name means \"Mandarin Orange\" in Japanese.\n \n After she loses her Alice Mikan is forced to leave Academy and have her memories erased to assure that no one in the outside world will try to target her to gain information about the school. Not knowing anything about the fate of Natsume and Hotaru she goes back to her grandfather, but she's allowed to take Bear with her under the condition that it will not reveal it's true nature to anyone. \n \n Four years later, Mikan is a highschool student and lives peacefully in the country protected by Shiki's barrier. One day Mikan is targeted by unknown people and is saved by Narumi. At the same time one of her captured and supposed childhood friends is revealed to be Hijiri Goshima in disguise. Confused, Mikan has some flashbacks but doesn't seem to remember anyone clearly. She stumbles just to find Natsume right behind her back. \n In the epilogue, it shows that Mikan and Natsume continue their relationship and get married. \n\n",

She is considered to be a geek and more than a little strange because of her aloofness. Like Natsume, she is usually poker-faced, but possesses some humor in her. She may treat Mikan unkindly most of the time, but it is apparent that she deeply cares for her. Somehow, she likes to bully people she likes.\n \n Hotaru is Mikan's best friend and the main reason why Mikan came to the academy. She and Mikan have what may seem to be a doubtful and strange relationship. Hotaru comes off as cold, quiet, geeky, and bad-mouthed but calm. Her \"stupid\" points are her tendency of being a \"pig\" when it comes to food and her greedy side, this happens in a comical manner. Her Alice is Invention, which allows her to create unique and strange inventions.\n \n She belongs to the Technical Class. She is currently a Triple Star.\n \n Her name \"\u86cd - Hotaru\" means \"Firefly.\"\n \n After Mikan wasn't able to save collapsed Natsume with her fading alice, Hotaru joined her brother and Nodacchi on their mission to find a way to save Natsume. Before departing she promises Mikan that she will be able to see her 'most important person' again. Then they travel back in time to the moment right after Natsume has lost consciousness. Despite Nodacchi's earlier warnings not to disrupt spacetime even further, which can cause unexpected events, Hotaru tries to save Natsume, but her brother stops her and heals him with his alice. Knowing the risk of changing the past they have no choice but to wait for their 'punishment'. Still Hotaru pleads to Noda to let her say farewell to Mikan before she leaves Academy and has her memories erased. After their meeting, Hotaru returns to spacetime without explaining Mikan anything and begging her in thoughts not to completely forget her if possible. As Noda and Natsume are about to go back to the present, Hotaru and Subaru are pulled deep into spacetime and disappear. \n \n After four years Hotaru and her brother are still trapped in spacetime, but are able to communicate with others through mushroom earphones. After regaining her memories, Mikan, Natsume and Ruka are ready for a quest to find and bring Hotaru back.\n \n In the epilogue, it shows that Hotaru and her brother stay in the spacetime, but she shares a happy reunion with Mikan and the others. \n\n",
