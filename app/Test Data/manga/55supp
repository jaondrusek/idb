Adopted by archaeologist, Fujitaka, he accidentally came into the country of Clow. Here he met daughter of king, Sakura. Currently he is traveling together with Fai, Kurogane and Sakura, in order to regain Sakura's lost memories, in form of feathers. But to do so, he had to give up his most precious thing - his relationship with her. Thus, even if she regains all her memories, she won't remember him.\n \n One of Syaoran's eyes is blind and seems to be connected to mysterious events surrounding him and his past.\n \n <b>Manga Spoilers</b>\n It is later revealed he is actually a clone of the original Syaoran. He was created by Fei Wong Reed to collect and scatter Sakura's feathers. Before being captured by Fei Wong Reed the original Syaoran manages to place some of his \"heart\" within one of the clone's eyes. At the end of the manga, Syaoran eventually turns against his creator and aids the original Syaoran in trying to save Sakura; however, Fei Wong kills Syaoran. Syaoran is reborn in another world, along with Clone Sakura, and he becomes his original's father. He and Sakura raise the original Syaoran until they send him to Clow Country to meet with his destined person, afterwards sealing themselves inside the glass tube. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Syaoran's original absorbs.\n \n Source: Wikipedia\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is Syaoron's twin brother who likes Sakura.\n\n",

After Freya eventually breaks down, Elda takes Freya's mind into her own in an attempt to save her. In the manga, this causes her own memories to reset. In the anime, Hibiya resets Elda's memories in order to find the One just for her.\n \n Chi has a special program installed on her designed to connect to every persocom on the planet. In the manga, if Chi fails to find the One just for her, she would delete the ability for persocoms to recognize humans from one another.

She loves to drink and eat Watanuki&#039;s wonderful cooking and dragging Watanuki on crazy outings at the drop of a hat.\n \n Despite this immature and free-spirited attitude, Y\u016bko has been known to be sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. Y\u016bko seems to know the true hitsuzen that Watanuki will follow, and has often offered cryptic messages to warn him of impending danger or a folk tale that he should take a bit more seriously.

However, she doesn&#039;t often appear to get directly involved in things beyond whatever contract she has with those making wishes. Sometimes, she sends Watanuki to do jobs for her, such as when she granted a wish from Himawari. Y\u016bko seems to take the role of someone playing chess when it comes to the big picture of things that are going on. \n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, she is a ruthless principal, who always climbs into rooms through the window.\n\n",

His given name, Syaoran (\u5c0f\u72fc), in both Chinese and Japanese, means \"little wolf\". His last name, Li (\u674e), is a common Chinese surname, meaning \"plum\". In Korea and occasionally in Taiwan and Hong Kong, it is romanized as Lee.\n \n <b>Manga Spoilers:</b>\n In fact, this Syaoran is the original while the Syaoran at Sakura's side is only a clone that Fei Wong Reed created. This Syaoran is of Clow Reed's bloodline and can thus use magic. He gave his eye and with it half of his heart to his clone to stop Fei Wong's plan temporarily. He was depicted as a villain, occasionally controlling the protagonist's movements, until it was discovered that the protagonist Syaoran is his clone.\n \n Syaoran is the son of Clone Syaoran and Clone Sakura (who were reincarnated in the another world). As a child, Syaoran was sent to Clow Country by his mother and father for seven days, because he was \"needed\". After a week with Sakura, he decides to remain in the country with Sakura. She falls under attack, and Syaoran hesitates to save her, which causes her to have a curse cast upon her that willl eventually kill her. Seven years after Syaoran's arrival, this curse takes full effect, and Syaoran hastily wishes that he could turn back time to the day he failed to protect her. Fei Wong Reed appears to grant his wish, exacting his freedom and time as a price, also creating \"replacement being\" for him, Watanuki. Syaoran becomes a prisoner of Fei Wong, his time rewound to seven years earlier, until the day the seal on the Clone's eye is broken.\n \n This Syaoran is able to summon the sword used by his father, which was passed down to him along with the alias \"Syaoran\". His real name is unknown. He uses the same spells as his father, including the devastating lighting based attack 'Raitei Shourai'.\n \n His real name is Tsubasa, as revealed at the end of the manga.  This is the same as Real Sakura's name.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is Syaoran's twin brother called Syaoron (\u30b7\u30e3\u30aa\u30ed\u30f3, \u5c0f\u9f8d).\n\n",

        "about": "Fai's introduction is in chapter two of the manga, in which he is shown sealing away King Ashura of Celes country at the bottom of a pool. He transforms his creation Chii (originally from Chobits) into a net-like shield, instructing her to alert him if King Ashura should awake. He then uses his magic to transport himself through dimensions, to the shop of the Space-Time Witch, Yuuko Ichihara.\n \n Out of his travel companions, Fai&rsquo;s motives for joining the group are the least clear. He was the only one to arrive at Yuuko's shop purposefully, by use of his own means. His wish was to never return to Celes country, but as the price for this would have been too great, he travels worlds with the group instead. He fears King Ashura&rsquo;s awakening, believing King Ashura will chase him through different worlds. The basis for this fear is as yet unknown. \n \n According to CLAMP, the correct pronunciation of his name would rhyme with \"eye\", so instead of spelling it like \"Fay\", as they intended, they thought that this would confuse readers. Thus, they stuck with the spelling of \"Fai\".\n \n <b>Spoiler:</b>\n \"When Fai's past is finally revealed, it is shown that \"Fai\" is actually named Yuui, and his twin brother is the real Fai. In Valeria Country, though the birth of the second prince's son was highly anticipated, the birth of twins was considered to be a bad omen. Shortly after their birth, the second prince died, and their mother committed suicide out of guilt for giving birth to them. In addition, the country suffered many misfortunes, and the twins, when combined, bore powerful magic that rivaled that of the current king.\n \n The king decided that making them unhappy was the only way to break the \"curse\", and since both refused to kill each other, they were locked up separately in a place where magic is ineffective and time does not flow: a tower residing in a deep valley; Fai was imprisoned atop the tower, and Yuui was confined at the base of the tower. Both were condemned to stay there \"until the world's destruction.\"\n \n Despite their unhappiness, the number of bodies dumped into the base of the tower began to grow. Yuui tried endlessly to climb up towards Fai, so they could escape, but he did not succeed. Eventually, the king became insane, and he executed every person in the country, save Yuui and Fai. He then jumped into the valley himself and committing suicide in front of a horrified Yuui, reminding him that their birth was the reason for the country's misfortune, and that they would now \"pay for that sin\" by being the only people alive in Valeria.\n \n Eventually, Fei Wong Reed appeared from another world, and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yuui, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death. Fei Wong then convinced Yuui that he is at fault of his brother's death and that Fai might be revived, allowing Fei Wong to use Yuui's guilt in order to turn him into his pawn. In order to bring his twin back to life, Yuui allowed Fei Wong to bestow two curses upon him, one of which was removed from Yuui's memory. Fei Wong then told Yuui that someone would free him from the valley, and that he would have to go on a journey, protecting \"a princess\" (Sakura), and killing any obstacles along the way. Fei Wong then tells Yuui that when he finds a magical feather, he should put it into Fai's body to prevent it from rotting, and that he should begin his journey when he finds a second feather, which he should give to Sakura.\n \n Later, King Ashura came to Valeria from another world in order to retrieve Yuui and took him to Celes. When Ashura asked what Yuui's name was, Yuui said it was \"Fai\". Ashura later gave Fai the last name \"Fluorite\", the name of a precious talisman mineral, and he eventually earned the title 'D', given to the highest magician in Celes. And thus, Yuui became the protagonist \"Fai D. Flourite\". He found his two feathers while helping villagers during an avalanche, and decided to use one to create a person, Chii, in his mother's image, Chii.\n \n Ashura eventually tutored Fai in magic and comforted him whenever he felt unable to overcome his dark past. When Fai discovered that he could only learn \"magic that kills people\", Ashura told him that his smile held the ability to heal others. In exchange for everything that he had done for him, Ashura asked Fai to promise that he would eliminate anyone who threatened Celes.\n \n Due Fai's first curse, Ashura traced a magical seal on Fai's body in the form of a Phoenix tattoo, which suppressed his powers from growing any further, and though Fai protested, Ashura told him that Fai's first curse would break after it was fulfilled once, and he wanted to be the one that Fai would kill. Ashura then erased what he had told him from Fai's memory.\n \n Several years later, a mysterious and deadly monster began to kill Celes's innocent civilians. Fai swore to defeat the beast, but found out that Ashura was the monster. Fai, at first, blamed himself for what happened to Ashura, thinking that \"the curse of the twins\" was what had caused Ashura to kill, but Ashura told him that his magic grows when he kills, and that he always knew that he would become a murderer, even though he was not sure why. Fai realized that Ashura had brought him under his care for the sole purpose of killing him when he reached this state. Unable to bring himself to kill Ashura, Fai cast a spell on him, putting him into a deep sleep. However, no magic spell was permanent, so the king would eventually awaken. In order to avoid having to face Ashura when he woke, Fai used his magic to teleport himself to the Dimensional Witch, where he began his journey.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the chemistry teacher.\n\n",

        "about": "Birthday: April 1 \n \n Watanuki is a high school student whose life has been a rather difficult one&mdash;not only have both his parents died, forcing him to live alone, but he is plagued daily by spirits that only he can see (both the ability to see them and the cause of their attacks are evidently heritable traits&mdash;apparently Watanuki's blood smells very delicious to spirits). \n \n One day, Watanuki enters into an agreement with Yuuko to work for her in exchange for the fulfillment of his wish&ndash;to never see spirits again. This marks the beginning of Watanuki's very involved part-time job, a fated meeting with a certain quartet from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, and so many \"chance\" happenings which occur not out of coincidence, but \"hitsuzen\".\n \n Watanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. Depending upon the person he talks to, his emotions tend to be overly exaggerated. With Himawari he throws himself into the air accompanied by hearts and a \"Himawari-chaaaaan!!\" squeal. With Domeki, he almost always expresses irritation with various facial expressions, screaming, and arm motions that reminds Himawari of an angry cat. With the exception of these two and Y\u016bko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness.\n \n One of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth. He found absolutely no value in himself and would often use himself to aid another, even if his life were at stake. \n \n An example of this is when he willingly gives up his right eye to the Spider's Grudge to save Domeki's, without considering how much his decision might hurt Domeki. He's forced to face up to this problem when trying to save the Zashiki-Warashi from the Joro-Gumo, when the spider matron harshly chastises him for his lack of consideration for both his own self and those who cared about him. Faced with the facts of how much he's hurt those around him, Watanuki begins to see some value in himself. He will still often use himself to save others, but now he is mindful of just how much his actions hurt other people.\n Life for Watanuki changes significantly once he starts working as Yuuko's assistant (rather, her very indignant indentured servant) who not only cooks (wonderfully), cleans (diligently), and complains (constantly), but finds himself performing very odd jobs and learning more about the occult. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia, xxxHolic Wikia)\n\n",

        "about": "Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran's fighting ability (along with Syaoran's blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite's true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran's sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as \"Kuro-puu\", \"Kuro-wan-wan\" or \"Kuro-rin\". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane's own statement that \"If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I'll kill them too\".\n \n His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' \"death\" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle.\n \n He obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left. \n \n At the beginning of the story, Kurogane told Syaoran that he would not help in finding Sakura's feathers, since it was not related to him. However, he ended up aiding Syaoran and the others anyway, teaching Syaoran how to fight and use a sword as well.\n \n In the Tokyo arc, Kurogane was involved in a short fight with Kamui. Later, he wished to Yuuko to save Fai's life, after Fai's eye was ripped out by the clone Syaoran. Through an arrangement by Yuuko, Kurogane and Kamui mixed their blood and forced Fai to drink it. Fai thus became a vampire and survived. Since it was not Fai's wish to live but Kurogane's, Fai can only take blood from Kurogane. Fai painfully refrained from calling Kurogane nicknames from then on, in an effort to distance himself from Kurogane.\n \n Kurogane noticed that Fai and Sakura were up to something in the Infinity world, but did not say anything. After Sakura left, however, he finally spoke up, refusing to let Fai give up his eyesight to go to Celes. Kurogane told Yuuko they would all pay a fourth of the price to go save Sakura's body from Celes.\n \n In the latter parts of Volume 20, Ashura used his magic to show Syaoran, Kurogane, and Mokona visions of Fai's tragic past. This caused an angry and betrayed Kurogane to unsheathe his sword and attack Ashura and Fai. He and Fai fought a fierce battle that devastated the room around them. In the mayhem, Kurogane destroyed the body of Fai's twin and managed to overpower Fai in that moment of weakness, saying to the overpowered Fai something along the lines of \"I thought I already told you I don't have anything to do with your past\". Kurogane then turned on Ashura, demanding to know why he'd shown them Fai's memories. The king responded by saying that he only wanted Fai to \"grant his wish\" and kill him. Ashura then launched vicious spells against Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran, Mokona, and a defenseless Sakura's body in order to force Fai's hand. In the chaos that followed, one of the massive ice stagamites that he conjured pierced Kurogane through his lower right side.\n \n Korogane is then apparently spared the damage due to the protective spell that placed upon him before leaving Japan by Tomoyo. He then stabs King Ashura, and after the King's death the group is seen possibly leaving for the next world.\n \n Fai's second curse caused him to suck up the world of Ceres; Fai tries to transport Kurogane and the others out of the small sphere that Ceres has become, but he doesn't have enough magic to do so. He only succeeds in transporting Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona. Then Mokona's earring (a magical tool made by Yuuko) was able to drill a hole into the sphere, but only one person could pass through. When Fai told Kurogane to leave him, Kurogane cut off his left arm and left it and Souhi as a sacrifice and rescued Fai.\n \n In chapter 167, Kurogane wakes up and finds himself back in his country, with Princess Tomoyo by his bed. Tomoyo welcomes Kurogane home and asks him if he has found out the true meaning of strength, to which he replies that he doesn't know. However, he explains to Tomoyo that he doesn't regret giving up his arm to take Fai with him, and tells her that he knows that some things can't be protected only by (physical) strength. This surprises Tomoyo, but she acknowledges that Kurogane has definitely realized the true meaning of strength. She then lets Fai into Kurogane's room. Kurogane seems genuinely pleased to see Fai, while Fai doesn't express much emotion, until suddenly he punches Kurogane. Kurogane doesn't quite react to this, far too startled. Fai then smiles at him, saying \"This is payback, Kuro-sama.\" The smile seems like the real thing, and Fai has gone back to using suffixes on Kurogane's name. Kurogane grins back, promising to beat Fai up for that.\n \n In chapter 169, Kurogane is approached by Fuuma who has come to Nihon Country with an artificial arm from Piffle Country, however Kurogane refuses the arm by saying that he \"will not pay anything to that witch for it.\" Fai replies by saying that he had agreed to pay the price while he slept, and gives up the last of his magic. In the second to last page of 169, Kurogane is seen with the arm attached, but claims that it \"feels weird.\"\n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the PE teacher.\n\n",

        "about": "Birthday: April 1\n Age: 14\n \n At the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend.\n \n When she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die.\n \n Fei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Y\u016bko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all.\n \n In order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Y\u016bko the thing most important to her and she pays Y\u016bko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking \"Who are you?\"\n \n At times, such as in \u014cuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more.\n \n Sakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Y\u016bko call her \"a favored daughter of the gods\". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Y\u016bko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to \"hear\" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn&#039;t. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over.\n \n Sakura&#039;s personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she&#039;s lost most of her memories, she&#039;ll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it&#039;s washing dishes or saving their lives.\n \n However, later in the manga, her personality undergoes a change after the clone Syaoran leaves her. As she voices to  Fai, no matter how identical the two Syaorans may be, the real Syaoran is still not the one she knows. Subsequent chapters show Sakura with a much darker personality, accompanied with gothic clothing.\n \n In the Infinity Arc, the group spent a few months fighting in a tournament, supposedly wanting to use the prize money to restore a world the clone Syaoran destroyed. However, the truth is that she was after the real prize - a robot (who is identical to Freya from Chobits) who can let one person and one person alone travel across dimensions.\n \n It is later revealed that Fai is under a curse that forces him to kill if he ever meets a person that is stronger than him. And in volume one, you can see that Y\u016bko was not hit by the rain, nor did she touch any of the people directly; this was because she was in another dimension to prevent Fai&#039;s curse from being activated. But when Sakura receives two feathers in the Infinity Arc, she was made stronger than Fai&#039;s halved magic and so he stabbed her, seemingly possessed. Sakura had a vision that after killing her, he would go insane and kill everyone else, eventually committing suicide, but she used the robot to transport her soul to a dream world, thus saving herself and stopping Fai from going insane.\n \n Later, it&#039;s revealed that she was not the original target of the curse, as the real Syaoran was. This is explained further in her appearance in xxxHolic; she changed the future so that Syaoran would not be killed. As she explains to Watanuki (Xxxholic chapter 140), her coldness to the real Syaoran was because she was trying to follow the dream as close as possible up to that near fatal event. It&#039;s later learned that Sakura can still be saved. The two places where her body and her soul went contains two feathers. Her soul went to the world of dreams, where it will be aided by the other Syaoran. So the real Syaoran, Fai, Mokona and Kurogane went to Celes Country to rescue the body of Sakura, as Y\u016bko told them it&#039;s the body they should rescue first, then the soul.\n \n At the end of the manga, her soul is eventually killed by the clone Syaoran, but just before her death, she reveals that she is a clone of the real Sakura. Her purpose was to map out other dimensions for Fei Wang, who created her, by finding the feathers. She is reincarnated in the original Sakura&#039;s body in the past, with her memories intact by Y\u016bko, along with the clone Syaoran. In this life she is friends with Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, of the Magic Knights. Syaoran and Sakura eventually meet and give birth to a boy, who turns out to be the original Syaoran.  They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, and then they are sealed in a glass tube in order to await the time where Reed attempts to shatter reality. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but both ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong, leaving behind only a feather which Sakura&#039;s original absorbs.\n (Source: Wikipedia, CLAMP Wikia)\n\n",

As Soel was made especially for Sakura, Larg was made for Watanuki.\n \n Little is known about Larg, except that it is able to see ghosts, something the White Mokona, Soel, cannot do, and that its main purpose is to stay in contact with Soel, so that Yuuko can know where the group is and assist them if necessary. Also, Black Mokona is used for teleporting things to the White Mokona and vice-versa. It is done by swallowing by one of them and spitting them out by other.  Yuuko has also remarked that of the two Mokona, the red earring on the white one possesses the ability to enhance magical power while the blue earring on black one has the ability to seal magical power.\n \n Like Yuuko, Black Mokona loves to drink sake. The name Larg comes from the rune Laguz meaning water. Larg is officially \"male\".\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is a twin of girl Mokona.\n\n",
