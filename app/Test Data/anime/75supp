      "synopsis": "In the year 2199, Earth faces its greatest crisis. Due to unrelenting bombings by the alien race known as &quot;Gamilas,&quot; the planet can no longer sustain its inhabitants. In exactly one year, humanity is set to become extinct. In desperation, the people of Earth establish the Earth Defense Force, their last defense against the power-hungry Gamilas Empire. However, humanity finds a glimmer of hope after receiving a message from the mysterious planet Iscandar, which offers them a device that would restore Earth to its former glory. With salvation in sight, the Earth Defense Force calls on the prolific Space Battleship Yamato and swiftly assembles a crew to make the 148,000 light-year trek to Iscandar and receive their aid. Among the crew are young officers Susumu Kodai and Daisuke Shima, along with several other newly promoted leaders, all under the command of the distinguished Captain Juuzou Okita. Forced to learn how to handle the ship&#039;s innovative technology while dealing with the onslaught of Gamilas fleets, the inexperienced cast of Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 must summon every inch of their resolve to survive the many hardships aboard the Yamato and complete their mission: to save humanity before it&#039;s too late.

        "about": "The science officer aboard Yamato, Sanada is earnest and dedicated, his ideas frequently saving the ship from destruction. His limbs are\n bionic, the result of a childhood accident which claimed the life of his sister and left him bitterly resentful of science&#039;s arrogance. He was a classmate of Mamoru Kodai, and blames himself for not having repaired the Yukikaze properly before it went into battle. When Susumu Kodai becomes acting captain, Sanada is frequently a source of advice. Sanada is the elder spokesperson for the crew after the deaths of Okita and Engineer Tokugawa.\n \n His Japanese name comes from real-life daimyo Sanada Masayuki. In 2199, he is also the XO (Executive Officer), second to Captain&nbsp;Juzo Okita.\n \n In the 2199 remake Sanada is the First Officer of the Yamato, and he does not mention anything to indicate the existence of his bionic limbs. Also, unlike the original series, where he blamed himself for the repair work of the Yukikaze, Sanada in 2199 felt guilty for Mamoru Kodai due to the fact that he did not inform Kodai that Operation M was actually a suicide mission to distract the Gamilas.\n \n (Source: Yamato Wikia)\n\n",

He is initially hot-headed and prone to bursts of anger, and at first blames Captain Okita for the death of his brother in battle. However, he matures during the first season thanks to his responsibility as the Yamato &#039;s battle chief, and ultimately Okita nominates him acting captain when he is unable to continue. Though apparently never formally promoted to captain, Kodai continues commanding the Yamato and its crew for most of the rest of the franchise, only relinquishing command twice: to Yamanami in Be Forever Yamato, and to a revived Okita during Final Yamato. He is also a talented pilot, flying his own Cosmo Zero fighter as the leader of the Black Tigers, and in the second season frequently joining the Cosmo Tigers in battle. \n \n His Japanese given name means \"to go forward, to improve.\"\n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",

She is from the outset attracted to Susumu Kodai, but conceals her true feelings with girlish glee. As the only significant female crewmember, she is also frequently the victim of fan service. \n \n In the remake, her personality and role changed slightly. Her role of a nurse was replaced by Makoto Harada; as a result, she is a full time radar operator. Her personality was refined to be more straight forward than the classic representation of her.\n \n Her name means \"forest snow.\" it originates from a fan of Matsumoto&#039;s named Miyuki Moriki. \n \n (Source: Yamato Wikia)\n\n",

He is in fact dying, and becomes increasingly ill during the course of the first season, but remains convinced that he will live to see his home world again. He regards Susumu Kodai almost as a replacement for the son he lost in battle, and sorely regrets his son&#039;s death in battle at Pluto, along with the apparent death of Kodai&#039;s older brother, Mamoru. Even when his illness leaves him bedridden, he remains a source of advice to the crew, and to Kodai in particular. In the movie Final Yamato, it is revealed that he was kept in cryogenic suspension for some time until the Earth physicdians could revive him and cure his sickness. He then went on to lead the EDF again in its fight against the Dingirians.\n \n He is based on Leiji Matsumoto&#039;s father, who was a Major in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and flew a Nakajima Ki-84 in Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\n",
