        "about": "The self-invented personal name of an elite net-diver from Earth, hacker \"Radical Edward\" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl assumed to be around 13 years in age. She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk.\n \n Ed could be considered a \"free spirit\"; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.\n \n Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.\n \n In the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.\n \n Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap L&uuml;tfen (he calls Ed \"Fran&ccedil;oise\", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means \"excuse me, check please\" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as \"Tomato\" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.\n \n Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.\n \n Ed has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also).\n\n",

        "about": "As an ESWAT member, Deunan is a specialist in weapons handling, explosive devices manipulations, hand-to-hand combat, and an excellent Landmate pilot. According the Appleseed Databook, she is trained to be ambidextrous. In the original manga, Briareos (her lover and partner) was a cyborg before Deunan arrived at Olympus, and she managed to lose an eye in Volume 4, due to a training accident. In the 2004 movie, it is shown that Briareos becomes a cyborg only after he leaves on a mission and is presumed (by Deunan) to be missing.\n \n The following data is from the 2004 Movie adaptation.\n \n The daughter of Carl and Dr. Gilliam Knute, Deunan, who is considered a highly skilled warrior, has spent almost her entire life fighting a war that has been, for the most part, over. It isn't until she is captured by an ES.W.A.T. (Especial Weapons And Tactics) team in the middle of a ruined city that she is finally evacuated from the Badlands. She also reunites with her former lover Briareos who is a part of the team sent to recover her. He is now a cyborg, having lost over 75% of his natural body to injuries. She also befriends a girl called Hitomi.\n \n The day after she wis brought to the city of Olympus, Deunan learns that over half of the population of the city is composed of artificial humans called Bioroids. She also found out that her new friend, Hitomi, is one herself. Deunan soon becomes embroiled in the fight between a faction of humans and Olympus as some humans strive to wipe out the Biodriods completely. When she's sent on a mission to retrieve the Appleseed, she learns of her past and also of a greater conspiracy.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia, edited)\n\n",

        "about": "Briareos is a prime example of the technology of cybernetic implants in Appleseed. Although his body is almost completely artificial, he suffers little loss in humanity. His outer skin is elastic, capable of feeling sensation, and the temperature can be adjusted to the cyborg's preferences. He has eight eyes mounted on his head, four in his face (The large sensor in the middle is actually his nose) two at the bases of his \"rabbit ear\" sensors, and two at the tips, which allow him to safely look around corners. His brain is augmented by an auxiliary brain that acts as an information processor, and is capable of handling information in a conceptual format rather than hard numerical data. His cybernetics controller, the Hecatonchires system, is named after the same 100 handed giants from Greek mythology. It is capable of controlling dozens of limbs or other cyborg bodies independently from one another, with no additional strain on the user. In the manga, it is pointed out that a cyborg equipped with the Hecatonchires system is able to fully control an entire aircraft carrier on his own. This ability to process multiple limbs at once is seen in the film when he is seen using one rifle in his Landmate's arms, and another in the control arms. \n \n Note: Briareos is the only known cyborg who has successfully integrated with the Hecatonchires system, all other test subjects could not handle it and died. This is shown in the latest Appleseed movie. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",

        "about": "22 years old and a 4th year student at the start of the series, Mayama is from Kanazawa, Ishikawa-ken and an architecture student at the art institute. He lives in the same complex as Takemoto and Morita. He occupies room 101, sharing the floor with an unknown individual and formerly Lohmeyer-senpai. He acts as a senior to Takemoto and tries to help Morita get up for early morning classes. \n \n Mayama also used to help Rika out with various errands while Rika was disabled due to the accident that left her husband dead. It is during that time that Mayama develops feelings for Rika. It is unknown whether Rika fully reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but various flashbacks imply that Mayama and Rika have 'fooled around', or Mayama took advantage of Rika's disability to fulfill his desires, although this is cleared up later as not being the case. Rika suggested that Mayama find another job so that she wouldn't have to continue hurting him, as she realizes how much he cares for her, and is unable (and perhaps unwilling at that point) to allow him to enter into her life.\n \n Mayama eventually landed a job at Fujiwara Design. He has to deal with coworkers that are also very interested in his love life, and make comments whenever they can. Mayama also has to keep watch of his boss, Nomiya, whom he considers to be a playboy, when Nomiya begins to take an interest in Yamada.\n \n Mayama doesn't return the feelings that Yamada has for him, but he sees Yamada as his close friend. Yamada's innocence is one thing that Mayama has to constantly guard from Nomiya, who has developed an interest with her.\n \n When Fujiwara Design later broke up, people had to either stay in the Tokyo branch or transfer to the Tottori branch. Nomiya arranged for Mayama to be transfer to the Tottori branch, but as soon as this was announced Mayama quit. He now works again with Rika at her company, Harada Design, after forcing himself into the position in his own way.\n Mayama's character design is based upon Suga Shikao.\n\n",

As the supervisor of the Grail War, it is his duty to uphold the rules of the Holy Grail War, cover up any incidents that might expose the War to the public, and give sanctuary to any Masters who drop out.

She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she had two personalities: a male personality known as SHIKI, and a female personality known as Shiki. Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the \"yang\" personality, while the female is called the \"yin\" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at any given time because both personalities have a distinct style of speech, most notably seen when the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi, while the male Shiki refers to himself as ore. \n \n After awaking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki&#039;s presence and assumes he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the dead Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the female Shiki&#039;s. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.\n \n Earl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down.\n \n Ciel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Midford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again.\n \n Despite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.\n \n Throughout the series Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga, he does not grow taller.\n \n The young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.\n \n As a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them, with the exception of Takano, who calls her a \"monster\"). \n \n In fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others, posing as a distant relative of Rika's and given the name \"Hanyuu Furude.\" Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form.\n \n She is very meek and often makes the noise \"Au au, au au&hellip;\" when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She also tends to end her sentences with nano desu (\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059?, lit. \"it is so\"). \n \n She dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu's and Rika's senses are linked together). She mentions that she is a \"being above humans\" after being sacrificed to atone for the sin of humans, while both Rika and Takano describe her as a kind of deity. \n \n Rika refers to her as \"Oyashiro\" when talking with others (evident from Shion's chat with Rika in Meakashi-hen) but does not personally think of her as Oyashiro; instead, she sees her as a close friend. \n \n In Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, Hanyuu tells Rika that she was sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people of the village, and Hanyuu asked \u014cka Furude (Hanyuu's own daughter and Rika's ancestor) to kill her and then make the village a better place.\n \n She is the one responsible for the eternally repeating June 1983, which she created in order to save Rika from being murdered.\n\n",

In spite of her young age, she is quite clever in setting up traps, and likes to practice on Keiichi. \n \n Although her personality is quite energetic and mischievous during the events of the games, Satoko's past was full of trauma; her parents died in an accident, she was abused by her foster parents (her aunt and uncle), and her beloved brother Satoshi disappeared. However, in Matsuribayashi-hen, Irie suggested she killed her parents, as she had a bad relationship with them and felt threatened, and so to her it was an act of self-defense. She is suffering from the Hinamizawa Syndrome at that time, and though Takano wanted to disect her alive for study, Irie fought to save her life. She is one of the few characters to ever recover from Level 5 of the Syndrome, but has to take shots on a regular basis. Though she greatly misses Satoshi, and feels that by being strong he will return, she comes to regard Keiichi as her new \"nii-nii\" (a cute term for older brother), and once even regards Shion as \"nee-nee\" (a cute term for older sister).\n \n She dislikes japanese pumpkin, and cannot tell the difference between cauliflower and broccoli, because she is colorblind.\n\n",

        "about": "Revy (\u30ec\u30f4\u30a3), sometimes referred by her full name Rebecca (\u30ec\u30f4\u30a7\u30c3\u30ab), is the female protagonist of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past, although portions can be pieced together through the series. Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting an unknown man while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\n \n The man who was shot was Revy&#039;s father, because she was fed up with her father.\n Revy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she&#039;s revealed to be highly ticklish.\n \n Revy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis&#039; boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\n \n She has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda&#039;s teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\n \n According to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf&#039;s Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\n \n Revy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\n \n Her weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS&#039;s; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\n \n Constantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

When he pilots a standard mobile suit ZAKU warrior (Phase 1), he is able to pilot it with immense skill and bravery. Noted for his skills, Durandal provides Athrun with Saviour, one of the new Gundams. He is extremely agile and fast and makes use of power, speed, and skill all at the same time. However, despite his improved skills, he cannot easily defeat enemy Gundam pilots such as the experimental Earth Alliance pilots. With that being said, although his skills in combat have a definite increase, they are not as skilled as that of Kira Yamato. After his Saviour is destroyed in battle with Freedom, Athrun gets the Infinite Justice and fights alongside Kira's Strike Freedom.\n\n",

He refused to take in any apprentices until he met Yotarou.\n \n As a child, Bon had originally trained as a dancer until damage to his leg left him unable to dance. Bon&#039;s mother, a geisha, sent him to train as a rakugo performer under the Seventh Generation Yakumo Yuurakutei alongside Shin, a boy who shows up unexpectedly and is accepted on a whim. While he proved to be adept at the basics of rakugo, and possessed impressive potential to memorize stories, his performances were stiff and lacked emotion and passion. Shin, with his impressive love for rakugo, quickly overtook him. As an apprentice, he was given the name \"Kikuhiko.\" In an attempt to find his own style, Kikuhiko began performing &#039;bawdy and erotic&#039; stories and discovered his strong ability to personify feminine characters.\n \n Kikuhiko pursued a romantic relationship with a geisha named Miyokichi, but broke things off in order to more seriously pursue rakugo as a career, leaving her angry and heartbroken. Desperate to have her revenge, she fell pregnant with Sukeroku&#039;s child, and the two eloped. After the Seventh Generation Yakumo died, and the crushing loneliness became too much to bear, Kikuhiko sought out Sukeroku at the countryside town where he had taken up residence.\n \n After bearing witness to the tragic deaths of Sukeroku and Miyokichi, for which he blamed himself, Kikuhiko took it upon himself to raise their daughter, Konatsu, Shortly after, he took up the title of the Eighth Generation Yakumo Yuurakutei.\n Yakumo passes away peacefully in his sleep, moments after finally reconciling with Konatsu and agreeing to take her in as his second apprentice.\n\n",

        "about": "Gender: Male\n Alias: Grey Stoke\n Genetic Type: Newtype\n Era: Universal Century\n Status: Alive\n Birthdate: October 10, 0073\n Age: 14 [MSG-ZZ], 15 [Evolve], 62 [MSCB-SH], 79 [MSVG-SS]\n Hair: Brown\n Eye: Green\n Family: Leina Ashta (Sister)\n Love Interest(s): Roux Louka \n Nationality: Earth Federation (Side 1: Shangri-La)\n Affiliation: Anti Earth Union Group, Gundam Team\n Occupation: Junk Dealer, Mobile Suit pilot\n Rank: Ensign\n \n At the start of the series, Judau and his friends are poor junk dealers at the space colony of Shangri-La in Side 1. Judau is rather loudmouthed and straightfoward, but has a good heart and displays powerful Newtype abilities. He has a younger sister named Leina whom he cares very deeply for. Their parents moved to another colony to find work and they send money back to them.\n \n While scavenging for junk one day, Judau comes across the escape pod of Titans pilot Yazan Gable, who managed to survive the Gryps Conflict that concluded Zeta Gundam. Discovering that the Argama was in port at the same colony, Yazan forcefully brings Judau and his friends along to help attack the ship. Judau breaks free from Yazan in order to steal the Zeta Gundam and sell it. He and his friends attempt this numerous times but fail, usually ending up saving the Argama instead from Yazan or Neo Zeon troops. They ultimately befriend the crew and join the AEUG, where they become known as the \"Gundam Team,\" with Judau piloting the Zeta Gundam.\n \n Judau's mission eventually becomes personal when the Neo Zeon kidnap Leina. He often goes into battle against orders since he is so desperate to save his sister. Strangely, Neo Zeon leader Haman Karn becomes fascinated with Judau and has a possible romantic interest in him. Although they are enemies, she always offers Judau - who is a Newtype like herself - a chance to join her side, which Judau always refuses. Artificial Newtype and Neo Zeon pilot Elpeo Puru also has a romantic crush on Judau.\n \n Eventually, Judau receives the Double Zeta Gundam (ZZ Gundam) from Anaheim Electronics and becomes its pilot. \n \n \n He almost loses his resolve to fight when it appears that Leina has been killed, however, he senses that she is alive and continues piloting, despite everyone thinking that he has lost his mind. In the climactic Battle of Axis, Judau defeats Haman in a one-on-one Mobile Suit battle. Haman kills herself, wondering how a person like Judau can be so good. Judau is reunited with Leina, who was alive after all thanks to Sayla Mass. He, Leina and fellow pilot Roux Louka quit the AEUG and head to the planet Jupiter to start a new life. \n \n He reappears as an old man, going under the name \"Grey Stoke\" in the manga Crossbone Gundam Skullheart in which he helps the protagonist Tobia Arronax. His Mobile Suit, the Gump, bears striking similarities in overall appearance to Judau's old MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam.\n \n Twenty years later, Grey appears again, alongside V Gundam protagonist Uso Evin, in the manga side-story of V Gundam. It is in this side-story, in which Grey is shown to have somehow acquired an intact, black LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam, that another interesting fact is revealed: Concealed underneath the Gump's odd-looking cylindrical \"head\" is its true head: That of the MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam\n \n Judau was also the central character of the non-canon crossover manga with Space Runaway Ideon, Mobile Suit Vs. Giant God: Gigantis' Counterattack, where the UC universe is in fact the universe Ideon remade at the end of the apocalyptic movie conclusion and Judau is said to be the reincarnation of Ideon protagonist Cosmo Yuki.\n \n (Source: The Gundam Wikia)\n\n",

He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of \"Tom's Workers\", with original name \"Cutty Flam.\"\n \n Franky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.\n \n Franky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood, or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.\n \n Franky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc.\n\n",

        "about": "The central villain of the Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure series, Dio is an immortal vampire and the arch rival of the Joestar family.\n \n He possesses a Stand known as The World, which has the combined powers of every Stand user born into the Joestar bloodline after the death of his enemy Jonathan Joestar (whose body Dio currently inhabits after he had his severed head sewn on Jonathan&#039;s corpse).\n <u>Series 1: Phantom Blood</u>\n Dio is the son of Dario Brando, an alcoholic and abusive father. Back when Dio was just a boy, he was brought into the household of George Joestar after the mysterious death of his father, so as to repay the debt he owed Dio&#039;s father for saving his life. But soon Dio&#039;s personality caused trouble for George&#039;s young son, Jonathan Joestar. Even more of a sociopath than his father, Dio was resolute to shatter Jonathan&#039;s spirit and take his place as the favored son, even going so far as to arrange for Jonathan&#039;s dog Danny to be burned to death.\n \n Initially, Dio is able earn the trust of the patriarch of the Joestar family through deceit (and at Jonathan&#039;s expense). However, his plans of taking over the Joestar household were discovered by Jonathan when he discovered that not only had Dio poisoned his biological father to death, he was doing the same to his adoptive father, all to take the Joestar estate for his own.\n \n Determined not to be stopped, and understanding the potential to enjoy power over all things instead of just the Joestar estate, Dio wears and activates the Stone Mask, becoming a nearly unstoppable vampire. His seemingly supernatural abilities are similar to the Mythical powers of the Mayan blood gods. He is able to walk on walls, and regenerate his body faster than fire can consume it. He is able to pressurize liquid in his eyeballs and then create small openings on pupils, eventually creating two fluid jets powerful enough to slice stone and kill living things. He is also able to vaporize his body fluid rapidly enough to freeze anything he touches. However, this is at the expense of having his body be sustained by sheer willpower alone, rather than vital energy. A sufficiently powerful vital force&mdash;specifically, sunlight or the Hamon force&mdash;will negate the sustaining force&#039;s presence and disintegrate the long-unliving body. Like all Jojo vampires, Dio sucks blood through tentacles in his fingers and has been seen at least once drinking blood from an unnamed girl.\n \n At the end of Series 1, Dio&#039;s body was destroyed, but his severed head managed to kill Jonathan Joestar and together they sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.\n <u>Series 3: Stardust Crusaders</u>\n The anime series and video game are based on this third arc, which occurs about 100 years later. At the bottom of the sea, Dio&#039;s severed head reattached itself to Jonathan Joestar&#039;s lifeless body (giving Dio the same star birthmark as the members of the Joestar family). Dio&#039;s casket is recovered by fishermen, who are implied to have been killed by Dio as he awakened. He finds that he is now in the year 1985. After he returns to land he develops a Stand (a sort of ghostly bodyguard), giving him vastly powerful new abilities on top of his vampiric powers. For most of Series 3, Dio is out of scene and in the shadows, and the question of exactly what his Stand \"The World\" can do is a mystery.\n \n In Series 3, many of Dio&#039;s offensive vampiric abilities do not appear, though he displays a new ability described as \"evil implants\"; parasites generated in his hair that attach themselves to and brainwash victims, finding early success with Kakyoin and Polnareff (In the fighting game JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure it is the vector of attack in the move called \"Charisma\"). Dio&#039;s Stand \"The World,\" as a sort of brother power to \"Star Platinum,\" possesses great speed and strength and, crucially, is able to stop time, making Dio appear to teleport or move at impossible speed. Dio&#039;s ambition is to create a perfect world for himself and his servants. In the interim, he seeks to drain for himself the blood of the Joestar lineage, which will help him to fully fuse with Jonathan Joestar&#039;s body and take better control of The World. Once he does this, his powers will gradually increase, until he is able to stop time for as long as he likes.\n The duel between The World and Star Platinum in Cairo\n \n In the beginning of the story arc Dio&#039;s World, Dio mainly battles Kakyoin and Joseph. Kakyoin succeeds in leading Dio into a vast barrier created by his Stand, trapping him. Dio uses The World to stop time, allowing him to ignore the barrier and approach Kakyoin to deliver a fatal blow. Before dying, Kakyoin deduces the The World&#039;s time-stop ability and uses his last strength to give Joseph this message. Joseph then warns this to Jotaro before he is also killed by Dio.\n \n After a long battle between Dio and Jotaro, Jotaro finds his own ability to stop time just before Dio drops a steamroller on him, proceeding in time-stop to break Dio&#039;s leg. Jotaro&#039;s intention was for the two to end the fight with a final blow once Dio&#039;s leg had healed. Dio, determined not to lose, squirts blood from his open leg into Jotaro&#039;s eyes. Dio then attempts a final kick with The World, which Jotaro blindly counters with a punch from Star Platinum. Star Platinum&#039;s hand breaks on The World&#039;s leg, but the punch sends a fissure through The World and through Dio, shattering Dio completely above the waist. Jotaro and doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation (an oil and medicine company loyal to the Joestar family) transfer the blood from Dio&#039;s lower half to Joseph Joestar, reviving him. Later, they lay Dio Brando&#039;s remains in the Sahara Desert to evaporate with the rising sun.\n <u>Series 6: Stone Ocean</u>\n In Part 6, it is revealed to the Joestars that his re-emergance was planned to create a perfect world when the moon reached a certain angle and time. He stumbled upon Enrico Pucci not long before Part 3 and \"healed\" his disfigured foot for him. After piercing Pucci with a Stand arrow, the two spent considerable time together, plotting and scheming. He questioned Pucci&#039;s loyalty to him, wondering why he didn&#039;t use Whitesnake to remove The World from him. Pucci had explained that he loved Dio as he had loved God, and thus worshipped him too much to betray him. Ensuring that he wouldn&#039;t completely fade, he left one of his bones in Pucci&#039;s care. Dio&#039;s presence continues to haunt the series, emerging in flashbacks and his disfigured sons. His bone played a vital plot element for the first half of Part 6, an odd green baby inheriting a Stand to merge with it.\n\n",

His given name, Syaoran (\u5c0f\u72fc), in both Chinese and Japanese, means \"little wolf\". His last name, Li (\u674e), is a common Chinese surname, meaning \"plum\". In Korea and occasionally in Taiwan and Hong Kong, it is romanized as Lee.\n \n <b>Manga Spoilers:</b>\n In fact, this Syaoran is the original while the Syaoran at Sakura's side is only a clone that Fei Wong Reed created. This Syaoran is of Clow Reed's bloodline and can thus use magic. He gave his eye and with it half of his heart to his clone to stop Fei Wong's plan temporarily. He was depicted as a villain, occasionally controlling the protagonist's movements, until it was discovered that the protagonist Syaoran is his clone.\n \n Syaoran is the son of Clone Syaoran and Clone Sakura (who were reincarnated in the another world). As a child, Syaoran was sent to Clow Country by his mother and father for seven days, because he was \"needed\". After a week with Sakura, he decides to remain in the country with Sakura. She falls under attack, and Syaoran hesitates to save her, which causes her to have a curse cast upon her that willl eventually kill her. Seven years after Syaoran's arrival, this curse takes full effect, and Syaoran hastily wishes that he could turn back time to the day he failed to protect her. Fei Wong Reed appears to grant his wish, exacting his freedom and time as a price, also creating \"replacement being\" for him, Watanuki. Syaoran becomes a prisoner of Fei Wong, his time rewound to seven years earlier, until the day the seal on the Clone's eye is broken.\n \n This Syaoran is able to summon the sword used by his father, which was passed down to him along with the alias \"Syaoran\". His real name is unknown. He uses the same spells as his father, including the devastating lighting based attack 'Raitei Shourai'.\n \n His real name is Tsubasa, as revealed at the end of the manga.  This is the same as Real Sakura's name.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is Syaoran's twin brother called Syaoron (\u30b7\u30e3\u30aa\u30ed\u30f3, \u5c0f\u9f8d).\n\n",

He started to ignore those around him (imagining them with a large X across their face) and was driven to the point of suicide. He changed his mind after he apologized to Nishimiya and began to spend time with her. He learned sign language specifically so he could apologize to her and is shown to be very talented in it. He feels like he hasn&#039;t been punished enough for bullying Nishimiya and often wishes he could kill his younger self. He seems resigned to the fact that he will never be able to have friends again.\n\n",

Since his transfer into Sakura&#039;s high school, he has tried countless times for Sakura to return his affection and is jealous of the time she and Rinne have spent together, and thus begins joining them on their ghost exploits. Since joining them, he has realized that not all ghosts are evil and has been more lenient towards some. He tends to jumps to conclusions, especially when something concerns Rinne and Sakura&#039;s relationship. It is hinted that he is Christian.\n\n",

        "about": "As an infant, his mother died in a carriage accident. That same accident indirectly brought Dio Brando into his life, because Dario, Dio's father, unwittingly saved Jonathan's father while he was preparing to steal from the wrecked carriage. Twelve years later, Dario apparently died of illness and Dio went to live amongst the Joestars. Dio, despite Jonathan trying to be friends with him, would become his nemesis both as a childhood rival and as an undead enemy. At the young age of 12, when Dio came into his life, he meets and falls in love with Erina Pendleton, but Dio shatters this relationship for a considerable time through his evil ways, by kissing Erina and boasting about it.\n \n Nonetheless, Jonathan is able to maintain his sanity and his studies in archaeology. Among his interests is research on a Mesoamerican stone mask that is part of the estate. Curiously, the mask sprouts spikes that pierce the wearer's skull if human blood touches it. Finally after eight years, Jonathan takes a stand against Dio when he discovers that Dio poisoned his own father with a substance that imitated illness, and his plot to poison George in the same way and take over the family fortune. So JoJo travels to ogre street in order to find an antidote which he finds thanks to the help of his new comrade Robert Edward O Speedwagon. In their fateful encounter, Dio stabs George while wearing the mask--Dio has learned that the mask is not a killing device, but a means to let the wearer transcend humanity and mortality (and anything resembling moral restraint) to become a mighty vampire.\n \n In the first confrontation with this new monster, Jonathan holds his own, but in his desperation to destroy Dio, Jonathan sets fire to the manor. in the battle, Jonathan, torn by the losses caused, grabs Dio and pulls him down many floors, ultimately impaling him on a goddess statue. However, Jonathan suffers horrible burns and is taken to hospital, whereas Dio is able to escape unseen. Robert E.O Speedwagon watches Jonathan being looked after and finds out that the nurse taking care of him is Erina, who had gone to India after Dio disgraced her and Jonathan's relationship--but not, after all, extinguished it. Shortly after being discharged from the hospital. Jonathan is taken in by Will Zeppeli, who teaches him hamon in order to defeat Dio. He travels with Zeppeli and Speedwagon to the town of Windknights to confront Dio. On his quest he faces many enemies such as Jack the Ripper and Bruford and Tarkus. And once again manages to seemingly defeat the vampire.\n \n Shortly after the Windknights battle, Jonathan and Erina marry, and soon set sail for America for a honeymoon. Their trip is cut short by an attack by Dio, now only a severed head, and Jonathan makes the supreme sacrifice, staying aboard the sinking ship in an attempt to take Dio down with him. Erina, pregnant with Jonathan's child, escapes the shipwreck.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

Keisuke drives FD3S and is a skilled driver, second only to his brother. Keisuke is a rather hot-headed young man and does not like losing. Keisuke is also known to drive with his emotions, for example if he realizes that he cannot win his driving suffers and if he is in the lead he is carefree and much relaxed. Before Ryousuke got Keisuke involved in street racing he was the leader of a Bosozoku gang. He joins his brother's new team and has a rivalry with Takumi. Keisuke races the Hillclimb (Uphill) on most races, while Takumi races the downhill.\n \n Keisuke isn't analytical like his older brother, and Ryousuke's ability to compute and analyze amazes Keisuke. But at the same time, Keisuke's ability to think less while he is driving, and to do only what he feels amazes Ryosuke. While Ryousuke has decided that he won't race much longer, and that he will become a doctor in the future, Keisuke has dedicated his life to racing, his eventual goal is to become a professional racer. But first he must defeat Takumi. Though visibly getting along, they still have some kind of argumentation over who is the ace, he has respect for Takumi. He stated once he was not as strong minded as Takumi, because Takumi fell asleep really fast before a great battle, making him ask himself if he knew what pressure was.\n\n",

He is often teased by Goku and Sanzou due to his lecherous behavior. However, he is a loyal and reliable friend who has a soft spot for women in danger who are in need of help. He is a half-demon, which granted him his red hair and exotic red eyes. His weapon in battle is a jakujou [a staff with a crescent-moon shaped blade attached to the end by a chain that can be elongated].\n \n When he was a boy, Gojou lived in a rather unhappy home. His demon father had had an affair with a human. His father later dumped his illegitimate child on his demon wife before abandoning her. His stepmother is the only mother that Gojou ever knew. She often took out her frustrations on Gojou, physically and mentally abusing him while weeping for herself and her situation. Gojou&#039;s demon older brother Jien would often try to protect Gojou from his mother&#039;s rage. No matter how hard Gojou tried, he was unable to win his mother&#039;s affection, and was tormented as much by the sight of her tears as he was by the fact that she professed love solely for his older brother.\n \n One day, Gojou&#039;s mother had reached her limits, and attempted to kill Gojou, first scarring the side of his face with her claws, then attempting to strangle him. Gojou was saved by his older brother Jien, who tearfully killed his mother before fleeing, leaving Gojou alone. Gojou later made his way in the world by first being involved in shady activity with his friend Banri before mastering gambling at cards. He survived the loneliness of the nights by bedding loose women. He used to despise his red hair, since it represented the things that his mother had hated about him.\n \n One night on his way back from a bar, Gojou came upon the bleeding form of Cho Gonou. He soon took the unconscious man back to his home and nursed him back to health. He was the first one that Gonou confessed his crimes to, bonding with the troubled newly-born demon over their different yet shared pain. Gojou tried to protect Gonou from Sanzou when the monk came to bring Gonou back with him for judgment. After Gonou left with Sanzou, who later informed him that Gonou had &#039;died,&#039; Gojou cut off his long locks as a sign of mourning. He was later reunited with Gonou, now Cho Hakkai. The two of them became good friends and roommates before embarking on the journey with Sanzou several years later.\n \n When Gojou previously lived in the world, he was known as General Kenren, a boisterous and flirtatious raven-haired god who lacked respect for all of his superior officers other than his friend Tenpou. He was fond of women, but was even fonder of sake, which he was often found sipping while lounging in one of the sakura trees in Heaven. Kenren was usually the one to ruffle the feathers of his superior officers, with Tenpou examining the results.\n (Source: Saiyuki Fansite f a t e d, Saiyuki Wikia)\n\n",

Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n \n Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook\", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing\". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n \n His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n \n Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more.\n \n It is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers. His father and one of the Yonkou, Big Mom, has arranged a marriage between him and the 35th daughter of the Charlotte family, Pudding.\n\n",

He enjoys odd habits such as dressing as a kappa during rainy days, embodying a Japanese pun on the word for raincoat. He enjoys eating curry. Although unspoken, he seems to be excellent at dodging any flying projectiles including Harima's Hurricane Kick and Tenma's arrow letters. Karasuma is secretly a famous mangaka, publishing his works under the pen name of Nijou jou. He is in a band at school, and plays an electric guitar. He also played soccer, and recently won a cup with the national soccer team in the anime. Although he doesn't demonstrate any feeling for Tenma (or anything else), behind his poker face he sometimes shows true concern for her in the story.\n \n He suffers from a disease that eventually erases all his memories after he goes to America. Because of this he hid his feelings for Tenma not wanting to hurt her.\n\n",

Not only is she able to read the thoughts of those who like her (as well as her sister and pet cat Iori), but further in the story it is shown that she also has the ability to communicate with ghosts.\n \n Skilled, reliable, smart, and beautiful, Yakumo is one of the most admired girls in the school. Despite that fact, she has never had a boyfriend. This is due mostly to her mind-reading ability, as she can easily read the secret intentions of any boy who tries to approach her. The only exception is Harima, whose heart belongs completely to another girl; thus, his mind is completely opaque to her. Even though Yakumo is the younger sister of the Tsukamoto family, she handles most of the household chores. She is also a member of the Tea Club.\n \n Yakumo eventually grows a strong friendship with Harima; which leads him to trust her with the critiquing of his manga drafts and keeping his pastime a secret. Eventually she takes on the task of assisting him on the actual inking of pages, which causes them to spend many hours together alone. Yakumo eventually develops deeper feelings for Harima than just the master-apprentice relationship. She keeps them hidden from him however, as she realizes he is in love with her sister.\n\n",

The \"Koto\" in Kotomi is derived from the Japanese musical stringed instrument of the same name. She is in the top ten for every subject throughout the whole country in standardized exam results&mdash;she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl and it is quite difficult to communicate with her. In her spare time, she plays the violin, although she is very poor at it to the point of causing pain to those who hear her play. \n Tomoya meets her for the first time when he enters the library and found Kotomi sitting on the floor barefoot, reading books with scissors in her hand, and acts oddly with Tomoya. After several meetings with Kotomi, Tomoya starts skipping the fourth period and spend time with Kotomi in the library. Tomoya decides to force Kotomi to join the drama club to make her more sociable. Just when Kotomi starts to open up to everyone, a bus accident causes her to breakdown in front of everyone and returns home later. Tomoya visits her in her house and learns that he and Kotomi were childhood friends, but lost contact with each other after Kotomi's parents died in an plane-accident. Not wanting to feel the pain of losing someone important anymore, and asks Tomoya to leave her alone. Wanting to bring Kotomi away from her past, Tomoya decides to renovate her garden, while the drama club members decide to gift her a violin, but was unfortunately destroyed. After renovating Kotomi's garden, Kotomi appears to Tomoya, and after some poignant conversation, Tomoya brings Kotomi out of her house to see the outside world inside her heart. The next day, her guardian presents Kotomi her parent's briefcase that has traveled all the way to Japan, and inside is a teddy bear and a testimony, asking Kotomi to live the way she wants and grow up to be an adult. Kotomi realizes she is still being loved by her parents even after their death and cries. After this, Kotomi becomes more mature, and the drama club members finally give Kotomi a violin. \n \n <b>In ~After Story~</b>\n In the anime adaptation Clannad After Story, Kotomi moves to America to further her studies. She, however, occasionally visits Tomoya and the others, and in the movie adaptation, Kotomi only made a cameo appearance, as she is only seen conducting a song for the members of the Choir Club.\n\n",

        "about": "His name is written in both Hiragana and Katakana as \u30ad\u30e5(kyu)\u30a5(u)\u3079(be)\u3048(e). So the more acceptable Romaji for his name is Kyuubee/Kyuubey. \n \n He is a familiar who can grant any wish to a certain girl, on the condition that she becomes a Puella Magi and fights against witches.\n \n When someone makes a contract with him, he extracts their soul and places it inside a Soul Gem, replacing their body with a shell that&#039;s more resilient to fighting witches.\n \n He has made contracts with Mami, Kyoko, Homura, and Sayaka, and shows particular interest in making Madoka a Puella Magi. \n \n It is unknown if there are other familiars besides him. He can only be seen or heard by Puella Magi and those who have potential to become a Puella Magi. He also disposes of used Grief Seeds for the Puella Magi, because, if they are used too extensively, the witch could become reborn from the Grief Seed. He also constantly tries to find chances to persuade girls who have potential to become Puella Magi to form a contract with him, despite the fact that he knows the dangers that Puella Magi face. Much to his dismay, he cannot force a girl to become a Puella Magi.\n \n He doesn&#039;t fully understand human values and questions any perceived differences between himself and humans. For example, when Madoka claims that he is cruel for forming contracts with girls and turning them into Puella Magi, he compares his actions to the act of humans slaughtering livestock, saying that, unlike humans, who show a lack of interest and sympathy for other creatures&#039; values when it comes to their own survival, he at least recognizes humans as being sentient beings and tries to negotiate with them. Therefore, Kyuubey is neither evil nor good, just a survivor like everyone else.\n \n <b>Major Spoiler:</b> Kyuubey is an \"Incubator\" and from an advanced alien species whose civilization is located far away from Earth. A long time ago, his species took alarm to the gradual heat death of the universe, and, in their search for a solution to it, encountered a species on Earth, humans, who exhibited emotions, something Kyuubey&#039;s species does not have. They then subsequently discovered a type of energy called emotional energy that could be used efficiently counter entropy, and also realized that teenage human females, who are very emotionally unstable during their mental and physical development throughout puberty, harbor the most emotional energy of all humans.\n \n Therefore, it is Kyuubey&#039;s duty to form contracts with teenage girls and to collect the emotional energy that is created when the girl becomes a Puella Magi. However, it is also his duty to collect the massive amount of emotional energy that is created when a Puella Magi transforms into a witch, and to consume Grief Seeds, which also contain large amounts of emotional energy.\n \n It seems that negative emotions such as hatred and despair yield more emotional energy than positive emotions, since Kyuubey comments that the amount of emotional energy created when a girl becomes a Puella Magi is nothing compared to the explosion of emotional energy created when a Puella Magi transforms into a witch. Thus, it could be said that Kyuubey&#039;s main purpose is to \"incubate\" girls&#039; souls in Soul Gems until they become filled with so much negative emotion that they transform into Grief Seeds and \"hatch\" into witches, and to then \"harvest\" the emotional energy created from the transformation.\n \n Also, whenever Kyuubey is killed, he is instantly reincarnated (for lack of a better word) into a new body with the same appearance and disposes of his previous body by eating it. He seems to have an endless supply of spare bodies, so, it might not be possible to kill him in a conventional fashion.\n\n",

Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi&#039;s family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.\n \n Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a \"lost snail\". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don&#039;t want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an \"earthbound spirit\" to a \"wandering spirit\", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.\n In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes.\n\n",

Ougi claims to be Meme Oshino&#039;s niece.\n \n In Hanamonogatari and Orokamonogatari, Ougi appears as a male.\n \n \n At the start of Kabukimonogatari, Ougi is seen having a trivial conversation with Koyomi about traffic lights, causing him to think about Mayoi Hachikuji.\n \n When Ougi meets Nadeko at the beginning of Otorimonogatari, initially appearing to merely want to tell Nadeko to stop playing the victim, it is later revealed that Ougi is the mastermind behind tricking Nadeko into becoming a snake god.\n \n Four months after Mayoi disappears, Koyomi has a conversation with Ougi in the classroom. After that, Ougi leaves by saying there is a lot of work to do. When Koyomi asks about the job, Ougi tells him it&#039;s basically work that involves punishing liars.\n \n Koyomi encounters Ougi on his way to North Shirahebi Shrine, who then states that they had been waiting there for him since morning to offer him some words of encouragement. When Koyomi says he doesn&#039;t regret turning into a vampire, they tell him that the reason they like him is because he is easy to twist around. As Koyomi walks off towards the mountain, Ougi tells him that at the cost of losing many things, he has matured.\n \n Gaen reveals that Ougi&rsquo;s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is an Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa&rsquo;s stress created Black Hanekawa, and Sengoku&rsquo;s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi represents Araragi&rsquo;s self-criticism. When Araragi saw \"Darkness\" for the first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law dictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too hesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished for a being that can judge him, and \"correct\" everything wrong in this world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi.\n \n In Suruga Bonhead, it is implied that male and female Ougi might be different identities or are the same oddity but reshaped depended on who the \"target\" is. Male Ougi appears to \"help\" Suruga but also still works with Araragi as his helping hand. \n \n\n",
