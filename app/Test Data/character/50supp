      "about": "Arisa is Shipon's best friend at the Stellvia foundation. They meet on the shuttle going to the station from Earth at the beginning of the term, and find themselves rooming together and in the same class as well. Though Arisa is nowhere near Shipon in academic or piloting ability, she finds Shipon to be an inspiration to improve herself, and calls Shipon her \"Star of Hope\". Later in the series, she begins focusing on becoming a mechanic, rather than a pilot. (wikipedia)\n\n",
