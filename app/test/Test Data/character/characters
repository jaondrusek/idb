        "about": "The self-invented personal name of an elite net-diver from Earth, hacker \"Radical Edward\" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl assumed to be around 13 years in age. She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk.\n \n Ed could be considered a \"free spirit\"; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.\n \n Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.\n \n In the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.\n \n Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap L&uuml;tfen (he calls Ed \"Fran&ccedil;oise\", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means \"excuse me, check please\" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as \"Tomato\" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.\n \n Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.\n \n Ed has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also).\n\n",

        "about": "Faye Valentine\n Birthday: August 14, 1994\n \n One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n \n Seemingly little more than a thorn in her partners&rsquo; sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\n \n  She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivet&eacute;. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: &ldquo;we deceive or we are deceived&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.&rdquo; \n Throughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the &ldquo;only place I could return to&rdquo;. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.\n \n\n",

        "about": "Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\n \n Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n \n During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.\n \n In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.\n\n",

The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.\n\n",

By using a special trick, Yukito is able to move his puppet without strings. He uses this to make money as he travels, with most of it going toward food.\n \n One day, Yukito arrives in a small town by the sea. Quickly deciding not to stay very long, he heads for the beach in an attempt to make some money. While by the beach, he meets a strange girl named Misuzu who quickly invites him to her house for dinner and, although skeptical, he accepts. Soon after meeting her mother Haruko and becoming friends with them, he is convinced into staying there. Yukito soon begins doing odd jobs for the local clinic after the doctor catches him doing his puppet show outside. It is here that Yukito becomes friends with Kano and Minagi; however, after getting to know them better he learns of their problems, which convinces Yukito to stay and help.\n \n After helping Kano and Minagi, Yukito finds out about Misuzu's illness, which is where she is unable to make friends because she'll begin crying uncontrollably. Yukito then leaves, deciding that if he leaves, Misuzu will get better; however, as he is about to leave, Yukito realizes his mistake and goes back to help. Here is when he realizes his and Misuzu's connection to the past and that Misuzu is the re-incarnation of the Winged Maiden. When Yukito finds Misuzu, she tells him of her last dream before falling asleep. Yukito then disappears in a bright light, causing Misuzu to wake up, seemingly better.\n \n It is implied that when Sora appears in the anime after Yukito's disappearance, Sora is Yukito or contains a part of Yukito's soul.\n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n",

Kano is a bit strange because of her belief in magic; however, she is an outgoing girl who loves the town's stray dog, \"Potato.\" After learning her mother died giving birth, Kano dreams of flying to meet her mother who she believes is watching down on them. Kano constantly wears a yellow scarf around her wrist, convinced she'll be able to use magic as an adult if she never takes it off.\n \n Kano's first appears when Yukito Kunisaki is hired by her sister. Soon after becoming friends with Yukito, she reveals her dreams of flying and the reasoning behind her scarf. One day, Kano disappears and Yukito finds her near the town shrine, where Kano attempts to strangle Yukito. He soon finds out from Hijiri that Kano did strange things such as muttering nonsense and trying to commit suicide when she was younger. Hijiri then explains that after Kano attempted to slit her wrists, she put the scarf around it and fabricated the story of gaining magic powers, hoping this cause Kano's suicidal acts to subside.\n \n Later, Yukito, Misuzu and Hijiri find a letter from Kano saying she overheard the whole thing and that she's going to fly away. They go search for her and find her at the shrine again. This time, her scarf has been taken off and there is blood around her wrist with no visible wound. A feather then begins to glow on the shrine and Yukito gives it to Kano, invoking a hallucination where Kano sees her mother. During this hallucination, Kano thanks her mother for giving birth to her and tells her she no longer needs the scarf. When Kano comes back, she tells everyone she saw her mother and that she is alright now. Kano then lets the scarf fly away into the wind.\n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n",

With an obsession with dinosaurs (which goes back to her childhood), she finds it difficult to make friends and is constantly left alone. Because of Misuzu's fondness of dinosaurs, she uses the word \"Gao\" frequently, which is the noise she thought dinosaurs made when she was young. Even though Misuzu's foster mother scolds her whenever she utters it, Misuzu constantly disregards the warning and continues using it in her everyday speech.\n \n One day, Misuzu resolves to make a friend, and after meeting Yukito, invites him over to dinner. Although Haruko disapproves of him at first, they all eventually become friends and Yukito is invited to stay. While playing cards one night, Misuzu suddenly cries without reason. Haruko soon explains that Misuzu has a condition where she cries uncontrollably when she comes close to making friends. Haruko brought her to a clinic and to a big hospital hoping it would help, but it didn't work. It was a mental instability, but the doctors said she would slowly recover as she got older. Misuzu's condition begins to worsen, prompting Yukito to leave. He soon discovers that Misuzu is related to a childhood tale he heard, and that she is the descendant of the Winged-Maiden in the tale, who has been cursed to eternal pain.\n \n Misuzu soon becomes ill; she becomes childlike and has to use a wheelchair. As a result, Haruko tries to adopt Misuzu officially. Unfortunately, before she is able to do so, Misuzu's biological father comes to take her with him; however, when he tries to leave with her, Misuzu refuses, calling Haruko \"Mama.\"\n \n Even though Misuzu stays with Haruko, her condition doesn't improve, and when Yukito returns, she is in constant pain. In the final episode, Misuzu asks that they all go to the beach together and when they get there, Misuzu attempts to walk to Haruko and Yukito, calling them \"her goal.\" Sadly, when Misuzu does reach them, she collapses and dies in Haruko's arms, ending the curse placed on the Winged Maiden.\n (Source: MAL Rewrite)\n\n",

One of the things Minagi enjoys the most is studying the stars at night. Together, her and Michiru created the Astronomy Club, which she forces Yukito to join. Minagi's mother and father are separated, with her mother living at home and her father away on business as a train conductor.\n \n Yukito finds out from Hijiri, the local doctor, that Minagi's mother has a mental illness caused by the miscarriage of her second child. When Yukito goes to see Minagi at her house, her mother appears calling Minagi, \"Michiru\"&mdash;the name she would have called her miscarried child.

She explains that she was a wandering spirit who came down to Earth because she saw a sad girl that she wished to make happy. Now that Minagi is happy, she has to leave. Michiru then vanishes. When Minagi gets home, she is given a letter from her father, explaining that he has re-married and new wife has given birth to a little girl. When Minagi goes to visit, she finds that the daughter is named, and looks exactly like, Michiru.\n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n",

        "about": "Tsukushi Makino is the main female character, and is one of the very few students at the prestigious Eitoku University to come from an \"unwealthy\" family. Her family is so poor that they can barely afford to pay Makino's tuition, but her parents push her on to continue school because they have a dream that she can \"snag a rich man\" and take them out of poverty.\n \n At the beginning of the manga, Makino was a poor, pig-tailed girl who had almost no friends at school and kept to herself. When one of her only friends falls down a staircase and bumps in the leader of the F4, Makino stands up for her friend (Domyoji was about to hurt her for bumping into him) and suffers the consequences.\n \n The next day, a red tag is hanging in her locker, which predicts future torment from the F4 and followers. But, unlike most of the F4's targets, Makino stands up for herself, showing how strong a \"weed\" can be.\n \n In this process, she changes to let her stubborn, hardworking ways show through, and in the end she turns all of the F4 into her friends.\n \n At first, Makino hates all of the F4 except Hanazawa Rui, (which she has romantic feelings towards). But, as Rui goes off to chase after Shizuka, Makino gets to know them, and even slowly falls in love with the hotheaded leader, Domyoji.\n\n",

Jo also puts Meg over anything else, which she stated when telling Meg that she fights for her only.

After being forced to surrender with Meg and others held hostage, Jo returns to the secret labs for reprogramming and conditioning at RAPT R&D. Jo's counterpart, Maria, freed her to only prove who was the strongest; Jo managed to remove her will to defeat her and restores her true humanity. Jo realized that she has to destroy RAPT at the source all for all that has happened as well as help Sei. Meg was highly opposed to the idea after seeing her go through a lifetime of combat and feels it's not their problem. Jo knocks Meg out, bids her farewell and leaves her communicator and jacket behind for her to remember by. After fighting their way into RAPT HQ, Jo destroyed RAPT's most powerful bio-tech brain and the whole building collapses. It is unknown whether Jo survived the explosion or not.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

        "about": "The 16 year old daughter of Chouyu. Originally, she was a helper at the Yang Spring Restaurant. She fell in love with Mao after seeing how much he loves cooking and how he also cares about others. She only knows a little about the cooking field, but she's useful when it comes to little facts and often tries to help Mao with various other things. After finding out that Mao was leaving the Yang Spring Restaurant to travel China, she was heartbroken since she thought that she could live a life with him. She eventually made up her mind and decided to also leave the restaurant, in order to travel with him (In the manga, she did not accompany Mao in his journey around China). Mei often gets into arguments with Shirou and always ends up slapping or hitting him. She also gets very jealous every time another woman gets near Mao. An example of her animosity towards women that gets close to Mao is when his sister, Karin, visits him to bring their mother's cooking materials; she says that Karin will never be good for Mao, that is until she finds out that she is his sister. In another occasion, when the female chef, Anzu, finally realized the way of making singe cuisine, she kissed Mao as a sign of gratitude, but Mei Li became angry and began to express her anger by hitting Shirou. Although, she says that her number one rival for Mao's heart is his love for cooking. She's a spitting image of her deceased mother, Meika.\n \n -Wikipedia\n\n",

The series depicts her as extremely diligent, although she is also a natural genius.\n \n As the series progresses, she learns to understand her mistakes and not think that she has to be perfect or else fail. For instance, after a rocky start to her training, during which she was dead last in her class at piloting, she takes the advice of Kouta Otoyama and realizes she was trying to keep track of far too much information on her ship displays. Her piloting improves dramatically as a result. Despite her early setbacks as a pilot, her programming abilities are top notch from the very start, and she eventually combines the two in order to become even more formidable in the cockpit. She is called Shipon because the first time she piloted one of the Biancas she flew around like a ping-pong ball.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

He has an older sister who runs an astronomical observatory in Japan. He often gives advice which is as enigmatic as himself.\n He consistently achieves rank C in every class, without exception, regardless of how easy or hard the subject is. And when he was warned of the possibility of Ayaka attacking Shipon during training, he displays extraordinary piloting abilities beyond what his ship should have been capable of handling. Another example would be during a simulator-game where Rinna scored Rank A, Shima scored Rank B, he had scores Rank S. When Shima asks why Kouta does not do the best during class, especially since he is capable of it, he merely says: he wonders why also. Pierre once remarks \"Talented hawks hide their talons\" when referring to Kouta's skills.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",

Before he can execute his plan, however, he's sent to El-Hazard, and once there encounters the Bugrom, a race of human-sized insectoid beings ruled by Queen Diva.\n \n Jinnai's power granted to him by the trip is the ability to communicate with the Bugrom, allowing him to become their military commander under their belief that he is the messenger from God sent to lead the Bugrom to victory. A skilled tactician, he is able to reorganize the Bugrom forces into an effective army and comes close to conquering El-Hazard.\n \n Although Jinnai is a power-hungry egomaniac, he's not without some level of humanity. When Galus attempts to stop Makoto and the others from halting the Eye of God's apocalyptic malfunction, he takes the leader of the Phantom Tribe by surprise with the help of a Bugrom soldier. Although Jinnai effectively comes to Makoto and Nanami's rescue, he does so more for the fact that a \"true ruler doesn't destroy the land he wishes to conquer.\" Jinnai has a very distinctive laugh.\n \n Jinni suffers from an obsession with Makoto that borders of the psychotic. Over the course of both series, he consistently blames Makoto for essentially every single failure and disappointment he experiences. His sense of his own history is a montage of misfortune, the chief architect of which is Makoto. Though generally megalomaniacal, one of his primary motivations in gaining power is to subsequently gain the ability to best, or, even kill him.\n \n Jinnai in The Wanderers\n \n Jinnai does not change much in the transition from OVA to TV series, either, but he seems to treat Ifurita with more care. Although he's threatened with impeachment from his position as Student Body President at the beginning of the series and Makoto plays no direct role in the trial, he is paranoid that Makoto will replace him as president once he is kicked out of office.\n \n Additionally, Jinnai reveals a softer side at the end of the series, showing a certain fatherly affection towards Ifurita after she stops the Eye of God from plowing into Roshtaria.   ~From Wikipedia\n\n",

Nanami has feelings for Makoto, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with him. \n \n Nanami's power gained upon entering El-Hazard is to see through the illusions of the Phantom Tribe, making her a viable defense against the greatest threat in the first OVA series. \n \n Nanami in The Wanderers \n \n The Phantom Tribe does not exist in the alternate timeline, and so instead Nanami has the same power to communicate with the Bugrom as her brother. Her past relationship with Makoto is also explored a bit more in detail, and she becomes good friends with Princess Rune Venus. As well, in the last episode of the TV series, Alielle describes Nanami and herself as \"special friends\", lending their relationship a certain homoerotic subtext, though this seems to be more along the lines of a big sister relationship. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n",

Holding true to the classic anime redhead stereotype, this tanned priestess' temper is as fiery as her hair, matching her control over the element of fire. Makoto, Fujisawa and Alielle first meet her when she rescues them from a Bugrom attack on Mt. Muldoon, but she runs off with Afura without hearing them out about their mission. When she first learns Makoto's true identity, she accuses him of being a pervert and tries to roast him, but after he saves her life when Ifurita awakens, she begins to have feelings for him. She also has a friendly rivalry with the wind priestess Afura Mann.\n \n Shayla-Shayla in The Wanderers\n \n Rather than be centralized in one location, the three priestesses each run a separate temple. Fittingly enough, Shayla's fire temple is located in a volcano. She is just as temper-driven as her OVA persona, but with the addition of being a heavy gambler. When Makoto and Fujisawa first meet her, she had lost her clothes and the entire temple to Jinnai in a rigged game.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",
