However, before anyone realizes it, the rulers cast aside their creed of purifying the chaos, and instead start to fight each other for each other&#039;s holy seals to gain dominion over one another. Shiruuka, an isolated mage who scorns the Lords for abandoning their creed, and a wandering knight named Theo, who is on a journey to train to one day liberate his hometown, make an everlasting oath to work together to reform this continent dominated by wars and chaos.
