In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of \u201cKiyaKiya\u201d and the related painting and drawing series. (Source: Official website)", "licensor": false}
