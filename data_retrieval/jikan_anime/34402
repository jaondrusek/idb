At the Kokuritsu Inaho Academy (&quot;Rice Ear Academy,&quot; a wordplay on national schools), five new rice-inspired students attempt to supplant bread as the popular grain at the school. The new students form the &quot;Love Rice&quot; unit and challenge themselves to perform at the &quot;Harvest Show&quot; to show the delicious appeal of rice grains. The &quot;heartwarming &#039;kome&#039;dy with laughs and passion&quot; promises to let audiences rediscover the virtues of rice (&quot;Japan&#039;s soul food&quot;).
