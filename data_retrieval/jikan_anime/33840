from a very young age thanks to his grandfather. Now, as a high school student, he desires to create his own kabuki club in order to bring an appreciation of kabuki to a wider audience. He&#039;ll find, though, that with the weight of hundreds of years of strict tradition, it&#039;s not so easy to get high schoolers interested. A rough start is not enough to deter Kurogu, and he&#039;ll work hard to inspire in others the same burning passion he feels, until the day he can put on his own performance!
