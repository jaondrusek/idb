Queen Shinou is the ruler of Ryoza and her greatest general, Grand Duke Taikou, defends the kingdom with his army of powerful war-lizards known as the &quot;Touda.&quot; Although the two regions have enjoyed a long-standing alliance, mounting tensions threaten to spark a fierce civil war. Within Ake, a village in Tai-Kou tasked with raising the Grand Duke\u2019s army, lives Erin, a bright girl who spends her days watching the work of her mother Soyon, the village\u2019s head Touda doctor. But while under Soyon\u2019s care, the Grand Duke&#039;s strongest Touda, known as the Kiba, dies. The peace that Erin and her mother had been enjoying vanishes as Soyon is arrested and sentenced to death. In a desperate attempt to save her mother, Erin ends up falling in a river and is swept towards Shin-Ou. Unable to return home, Erin must learn to lead a new life with completely different people, all while hunting for the truth of both beasts and humanity itself, with tensions between the two regions constantly escalating.
