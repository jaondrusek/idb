battlefield, which she cannot forget. These words were given to her by someone she holds dear, more than anyone else. She does not yet know their meaning. A certain point in time, in the continent of Telesis. The great war which divided the continent into North and South has ended after four years, and the people are welcoming a new generation. Violet Evergarden, a young girl formerly known as &quot;the weapon&quot;, has left the battlefield to start a new life at CH Postal Service. There, she is deeply moved by the work of &quot;Auto Memories Dolls&quot;, who carry people&#039;s thoughts and convert them into words. Violet begins her journey as an Auto Memories Doll, and comes face to face with various people&#039;s emotions and differing shapes of love. All the while searching for the meaning of those words.
