His unique kamishibai storytelling draws them into tales of fear and dread. These are dark and foreboding stories, which could happen to anyone... This season has tales of a salaryman who buries a dead cat, only to be haunted soon after; a college student and her cheap new apartment that hides a ghastly secret; boys exploring an abandoned haunted house before coming across a strange fish tank; a man who finds himself on the wrong bus, and in more danger than he thought possible; and a young couple&#039;s visit to an amusement park, which suddenly takes a dark turn. All these stories and more await in Yami Shibai 4th Season. [Written by MAL Rewrite]", "title-english": "Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories 4", "licensor": false}
