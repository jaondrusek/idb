Within the game, he&#039;s a 15-year-old named Satou. At first he thinks he&#039;s dreaming, but his experiences seem very real. Due to a powerful ability he possesses with limited use, he ends up wiping out an army of lizard men and becomes a high leveled adventurer. Satou decides to hide his level, and plans to live peacefully and meet new people. However, developments in the game&#039;s story, such as the return of a demon king, may cause a nuisance to Satou&#039;s plans.
