the population of Sakurada, a small town near the Pacific Ocean, has some sort of unique power. These powers range from being able to enter the mind of a cat, to resetting the world back to a certain point in time in the past. There is a group known as the &quot;Kanrikyoku&quot; that controls and monitors the use of these powers. Asai Kei and Haruki Misora work for their school&#039;s club called &quot;Houshi&quot; club, which execute any missions received from the Kanrikyoku. Misora has the ability to reset the world 3 days. This means that all events and any memory of the past 3 days that &quot;could have&quot; happened, never happened. Kei has the ability to &quot;remember&quot; the past. Even after Misora uses her powers to reset the world back 3 days, Kei will retain those 3 days in his memory. Combining their powers, these two solve missions issued by the Kanrikyoku.
