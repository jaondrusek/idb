Zeon intelligence has identified a prototype Federation Gundam under development in a Federation base in the Arctic. Elite Zeon MS commandos are dispatched to destroy the prototype, but before they can accomplish their mission the Gundam is launched into space. When the Gundam turns up in a Federation R&D base inside the neutral space colony Side 6, the Principality launches a covert operation to destroy the Gundam. The raid fails and Zeon will launch a nuclear strike against the colony unless the last remaining commando can eliminate the Gundam. (source: Wikipedia)", "volumes": 1, "published": "1990"}
