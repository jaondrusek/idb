"Miyoko Tanashi lived a charmed life with her parents, but after losing both of them in a devastating train accident, the life she knew was suddenly ripped away. Sent to a secluded orphanage in the mountains, she is subjected to inhumane abuse at the hands of her caretakers; escape is not an option since runaways are met with a fate far worse than death. But eventually, Miyoko manages to flee and receive aid from her father&#039;s mentor\u2014a researcher named Dr. Hifumi Takano. Adopted by Hifumi and finally free from her hell, Miyoko takes on a different identity to go along with her new life. When Hifumi&#039;s research on a mysterious disease in a mountain village is ridiculed, Miyoko makes it her life&#039;s work to prove that the disease truly exists. However, her mission soon turns into a deadly obsession once she arrives in the village, as she is more than willing to prove the doctor&#039;s findings by any means necessary... In the conclusion to the Higurashi story, warring fates and indomitable wills clash in this final confrontation in June of 1983.
