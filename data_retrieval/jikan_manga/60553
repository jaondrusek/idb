When he opens his eyes, though, he sees a beautiful goddess that offers him a once in an after-lifetime chance to be reborn in a parallel world. The catch is that the world is violent and threatened by a growing evil! Fortunately, he can choose any one thing to bring with him. So he chooses the goddess, Aqua! And so his adventure with his gorgeous companion begins\u2014if he could just get enough money and food to survive, keep his goddess out of trouble, and avoid grabbing the attention of the Demon King&#039;s army!
