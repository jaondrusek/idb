Hellsalem&#039;s Lot was created in a single night when a portal to the &quot;Beyond&quot; opened, and now it is a paranormal melting pot of monsters, magic, and the everyday mundane city life. It&#039;s up to Libra to prevent the horrors of this city from spreading to the outside world. When mild-mannered Leonard Watch arrives in the city, he&#039;s inducted into Libra and things spiral out of control from there.
