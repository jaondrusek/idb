The world knew that witches existed and that they practiced the notorious art of sorcery. Nevertheless, the world did not know anything about the study of magic. Our story follows a half-man, half-beast mercenary; humans mockingly call his kind the &quot;fallen beasts.&quot; He always dreamt of becoming a human, but one day, he met a witch who would change his life forever. &quot;Do you desire a human form? Then be my escort, mercenary!&quot; The witch introduced herself as &quot;Zero,&quot; and explained that she was searching for a one-of-a-kind magical tome that someone had stolen from her lair. Entitled &quot;The Book of Zero,&quot; the grimoire supposedly contained valuable magical knowledge that could be used to effortlessly bring the world to its knees. Thus, in order to realize his dream of becoming a human, the mercenary must accompany Zero on her journey\u2014despite her being one of the witches he so loathed. This is the story of a haughty sorceress and a kindhearted beast. (Source: Nanodesu)", "volumes": "Unknown", "published": "Feb  8, 2014 to ?"}
