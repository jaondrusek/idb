come with her to her family&#039;s Nagano home for a summer job, he agrees without hesitation. Natsuki&#039;s family, the Jinnouchi clan, dates back to the Muromachi era (1336 to 1573), and they&#039;ve all come together to celebrate the 90th birthday of the spunky matriarch of the family, Sakae. That&#039;s when Kenji discovers his &quot;summer job&quot; is to pretend to be Natsuki&#039;s fiance and dance with her at the birthday celebration. As Kenji attempts to keep up with Natsuki&#039;s act around her family, he receives a strange math problem on his cell phone which, being a math genius, he can&#039;t resist solving. As it turns out, the solution to the mysterious equation causes a bizarre parallel world to collide with Earth, and it&#039;s up to Kenji and his new fake family to put reality back in order.
