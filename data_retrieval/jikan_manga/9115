Or so it was until one peculiar day where the trader finds a young, naked, wolf-like girl asleep in his wagon. The beautiful girl, calling herself Holo, claims to be a local wolf deity worshipped by locals as the God of Good Harvest. Year after year, she ensured they would reap a good harvest, but she has since grown tired of fulfilling the wishes of the ungrateful locals. Holo ends up striking a deal with Kraft: if he helps her escape the villagers, she will gladly help him in his merchant endeavours. Together, they roam from town to town in search of business, and Kraft realizes both the ups and downs of travelling with a haughty and shrewd wolf goddess.
