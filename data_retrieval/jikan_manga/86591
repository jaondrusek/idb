Located near the business district and nestled in a poor corner of the shopping district in the first basement floor of a multi-business building. From 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. is lunch time, and 6 P.M. to 9 P.M. is dinner time. During holidays and weekends, the business district becomes empty. Lunch is up to 1000 yen. You have your free choice of rice, bread, and soup and it&#039;s a good variety. On the signboard mounted on the store&#039;s entrance is the image of a beckoning cat. The cat&#039;s bell is the main feature of this mascot. My cat-loving grandpa left this small store to me who, if I had to say, liked dogs better. In other words, an average restaurant you can find anywhere. ...Ah, but there&#039;s one thing that&#039;s different from other places. Every Saturday, the store has some very special guests come in, and it becomes a business day. Shouldn&#039;t the store be closed? That&#039;s right. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a special sale. Only on Saturday, we welcome only these special customers, and because of that, superficially it&#039;s a holiday. Even I don&#039;t know when my grandpa started doing this. But, &quot;Those on the Other Side&quot; call this place &quot;The Other World Dining Hall.&quot; (Source: Youshoku Translations)", "volumes": "Unknown", "published": "Feb  28, 2015 to ?"}
