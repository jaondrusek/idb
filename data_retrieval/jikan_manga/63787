Each half is separated by the Orielal River. In this world, special abilities called spell formulas (\u5492\u5f0f, jushiki) exist, which are essentially chemical reactions augmented through special weapons that cause a magic spell-like effect. These special weapons are called Magic Staff weapons, and are as varied as regular weapons are. Spell formulists use these spell formulas to fight with &quot;Beasts of Abhorrent Form,&quot; natural creatures that use spell formulas and pose a threat to humans, such as Dragons, Aions, or Enormes. The story focuses on the two main characters, Gaius Sorel and Gigina Ashley-Bufh, the only two employees of Spell Formulist dispatch office Ashley-Bufh &amp; Sorel Co. They are met with a variety of requests from a variety of clients, all requiring the adept use of spell formulas. (Source: LNDB.info)", "volumes": "Unknown", "published": "May  20, 2008 to ?"}
