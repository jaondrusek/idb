The new club member, Yuri Oshimoto, is forced to be the straightman to her idiotic upperclassmen. Then there&#039;s Kanae Shinjou, the stupidity-machine who can&#039;t play tennis even though she&#039;s in the tennis club; Marimo Bandou, the unpredictable super-pervert from Kansai; and Nasuno Takamiya, the air-headed, mysterious rich girl who tries to solve everything with money. Today, tomorrow, and the day after, regardless if they&#039;re all there or not, it&#039;s a tennis manga you can&#039;t help but roar in laughter at?! And in the fall of 2012, you might get caught up in the &quot;Teekyuu&quot; whirlwind even further?!
