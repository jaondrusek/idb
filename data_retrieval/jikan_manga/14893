is a story, a &quot;ghostory&quot; of sorts, about scars that bond, monsters that haunt, and fakes that deceive. The story of Koyomi Araragi begins through a fateful encounter with the all-powerful, blonde-haired, &quot;hot-blooded, iron-blooded and cold-blooded&quot; vampire, later introduced as Shinobu Oshino. Their tragic rendezvous results in the end of Araragi&#039;s life as a human and his subsequent rebirth as a vampire\u2014a monster. However, this encounter is only the start of his meddlings with the supernatural. Koyomi&#039;s noble personality ultimately sees him getting further involved in the lives of others with supernatural afflictions. This is his desperate attempt at returning to a normal human life, in a paranormal world filled with nothing but tragedy, suffering, and inhumanity. [Written by MAL Rewrite] This entry includes the first season of the Monogatari Series.", "volumes": 6, "published": "Nov  1, 2006 to Jul  28, 2010"}
