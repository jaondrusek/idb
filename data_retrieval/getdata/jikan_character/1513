{"about": "Birthday: October 13\n Height: 154cm\n \n Nerine is the daughter of the Lord of Devils and, like Sia, is also a marriage candidate for Rin. Nerine is a more capable magic user than Sia, and occasionally uses it to devastating effect. Similar to Sia, Nerine has absorbed the spirit of Lycoris, her clone. Unlike Sia, however, this has not led her to developing multiple personalities and only caused her to share Lycoris' emotions and singing voice.\n\n", "name": "Nerine ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/50899.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157292.jpg?s=beede378142dc1d1eae9d12789b3daed", "link": "/manga/1788/Shuffle", "name": "Shuffle!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/7984.jpg?s=4b1aa1b6bbc0ffbd2efc2d2aeb757c4d", "link": "/manga/6234/Shuffle__Tick_Tack", "name": "Shuffle: Tick!
