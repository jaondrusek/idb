{"about": "The current human incarnation of the Organic Angel, Alexiel. Though dormant inside him, Alexiel retains many of her high astral powers and Setsuna is almost impervious to injury. Like all of Alexiel's reincarnations, Setsuna was doomed to live a miserable life and die a slow, painful death. However, the cycle is partially broken when Nanatsusaya kills Alexiel's previous incarnation. It is then completely destroyed when Setsuna's younger sister, Sara, dies in his place. He is hopelessly in love with his sister Sara. He also has no memories of his previous incarnations, and at first resents his role as the chosen \"Savior\", wishing only to protect his and Sara's happiness. He matures as the series progresses, eventually surpassing Alexiel herself. Setsuna is headstrong, rebellious, and impulsive, but he has a good heart and is fiercely loyal to his friends.\n\n", "name": "Setsuna Mudo", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/82416.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/176257.jpg?s=0ac9405585994278f49ff97558ea9b13", "link": "/manga/448/Tenshi_Kinryouku", "name": "Tenshi Kinryouku"}], "member-favorites": 99, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/45208.jpg?s=aa872a6af05f3f49d771fb8e9db33d75", "link": "/anime/51/Tenshi_Kinryouku", "name": "Tenshi Kinryouku"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7121\u9053\u5239\u90a3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41532v.jpg", "link": "/people/74/Kenji_Nojima", "name": "Nojima, Kenji", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/21809v.jpg", "link": "/people/1656/Sebastian_Schulz", "name": "Schulz, Sebastian", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37231v.jpg", "link": "/people/6420/Stefano_Crescentini", "name": "Crescentini, Stefano", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/19993v.jpg", "link": "/people/17237/Scott_Cargle", "name": "Cargle, Scott", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/18863/Cyrille_Artaux", "name": "Artaux, Cyrille", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/21155v.jpg", "link": "/people/18879/Toni_Mora", "name": "Mora, Toni", "language": "Spanish"}]}
