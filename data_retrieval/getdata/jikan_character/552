{"about": "Knight of Plants. Shin is the youngest member of the Leafe Knights and is the Knight of Plants. He uses his abilities to seal away Demon Larvae, as well as using the spell 'Beyondios' to create a separate dimension so that when the knights and the Pr&eacute;tear are battling Demon Larvae, they do not harm the surrounding environment. Like the other two younger Knights, Shin died sixteen years ago while fighting the Princess of Disaster and was reborn.\n\n", "name": "Shin ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/51318.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5198.jpg?s=3084486b7a95d16269628100962eb2a5", "link": "/manga/1248/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pretear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pretear"}], "member-favorites": 14, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/11709.jpg?s=7a57674adb524128ed1d74c332344b12", "link": "/anime/100/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pr\u00e9tear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pr\u00e9tear"}], "name-japanese": "(\u65b0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/19625v.jpg", "link": "/people/606/Sasha_Paysinger", "name": "Paysinger, Sasha", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1183v.jpg", "link": "/people/1061/Tamaki_Nakanishi", "name": "Nakanishi, Tamaki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/1277v.jpg", "link": "/people/1284/Jolanda_Granato", "name": "Granato, Jolanda", "language": "Italian"}]}
