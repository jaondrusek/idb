{"about": "Knight of Light. Kei is the Knight of Light and works at an Electronic Gaming Company. Kei is the most practical and direct of the Knights, which sometimes leads to confrontation. Kei is also a narcissist, as illustrated by the numerous self-depicting toys and pictures in his work cubicle in the anime.\n \n In the manga he's actually 15 and not a narcissist, but a blunt know-it-all teen. Which leads to many disputes with Goh, and Mannen.\n\n", "name": "Kei ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/51408.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5198.jpg?s=3084486b7a95d16269628100962eb2a5", "link": "/manga/1248/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pretear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pretear"}], "member-favorites": 12, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/11709.jpg?s=7a57674adb524128ed1d74c332344b12", "link": "/anime/100/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pr\u00e9tear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pr\u00e9tear"}], "name-japanese": "(\u86cd)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/1282v.jpg", "link": "/people/1290/Leonardo_Graziano", "name": "Graziano, Leonardo", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/2777v.jpg", "link": "/people/6145/Makoto_Naruse", "name": "Naruse, Makoto", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/12220v.jpg", "link": "/people/12492/Victor_Carsrud", "name": "Carsrud, Victor", "language": "English"}]}
