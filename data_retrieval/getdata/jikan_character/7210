He was originally hired to rescue Tiffa Adill from the Vulture ship Freeden but upon realising his employer only wanted to exploit her later becomes part of its crew. For much of the series, he nurses a fairly obvious crush on Tiffa but does not act, fearing that the Tiffa would be unnerved by his advances, since she was denied most of her childhood.
