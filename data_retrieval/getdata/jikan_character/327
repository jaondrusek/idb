His name is romanized as Syusuke Fuji in the Japanese anime, and Sh\u016bsuke Fuji in all the English versions. He is voiced by Yuki Kaida in the original version of the anime, and voiced by Adam Lawson in the English dubbed version until episode 31, where he is replaced by Johnny Yong Bosch.\n \n <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Background</b></div>\n \n Sh\u016bsuke Fuji is a third year student at Seishun Academy. He is given the title \"tensai\", or genius, due to his tactical skill on the tennis court. He is in the same class as  Eiji Kikumaru, and is Eiji's good friend. Fuji is a leap year baby (his birthday is on February 29), and thus he can only properly celebrate his birthday once every four years. Fuji is cheerful and easygoing, with a penchant for playfully teasing those around him.\n \n He is the middle child of the Fuji family. His unnamed father is a foreign-based employee, and is never seen in the series. His mother, 49-year-old Yoshiko, who also has perpetually-closed eyes, is seen in the manga as a kind and dedicated Japanese housewife. His younger brother, Y\u016bta, is a tennis player at St. Rudolph Middle School. Fuji's older sister, 24-year-old Yumiko, is considered very attractive and is popular among both Fuji and Y\u016bta's friends.\n \n He grew up in Chiba, where he became friends with Kojir\u014d Saeki, the current vice-captain of Rokkaku Middle School Tennis Club. Later on, he moved to Tokyo and entered Seigaku.\n \n Fuji usually takes the position of S2 (Singles 2), although sometimes he is paired with Kawamura Takashi or Kikumaru Eiji in Doubles (with Kikumaru, they are called the \"Dream Pair\"). Also, he and Echizen Ryoma temporarily take turns for the position of S1 (Singles 1) when captain Tezuka Kunimitsu is in rehabilitation.\n (Sources: Kuryujiru Live Journal, Prince of Tennis Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Shuusuke Fuji", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/92888.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/153238.jpg?s=ff21d030366ef2514d0912e0ff66227a", "link": "/manga/49/Tennis_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Tennis no Ouji-sama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/109185.jpg?s=6b435bea2a6ddd9d8ccc99317107a8d9", "link": "/manga/11153/Houkago_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Houkago no Ouji-sama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/153234.jpg?s=83a99edcf903661f9eee35653c80841d", "link": "/manga/12965/Shin_Tennis_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Shin Tennis no Ouji-sama"}], "member-favorites": 832, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/21624.jpg?s=7ff8f45bd04135e5f2aefdc2f25bfb0d", "link": "/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis", "name": "Prince of Tennis"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/6381.jpg?s=38c383dc9a048ade66485539079e8bff", "link": "/anime/814/Prince_of_Tennis__Atobes_Gift", "name": "Prince of Tennis: Atobe's Gift"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/3945.jpg?s=9fe19ca6946832ba12b92221106b20c6", "link": "/anime/815/Prince_of_Tennis__The_Two_Samurai_The_First_Game", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The Two Samurai, The First Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/10572.jpg?s=8af0a90724a3699db8d7d90011e264a3", "link": "/anime/995/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/4471.jpg?s=2a84683e3aa6c468a95c62a1b2ac69f7", "link": "/anime/1190/Prince_of_Tennis__A_Day_on_Survival_Mountain", "name": "Prince of Tennis: A Day on Survival Mountain"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/3713.jpg?s=bf97a1e2f48fb1e40afaf402e2f4ebc6", "link": "/anime/2752/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament_Semifinals", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament Semifinals"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/7525.jpg?s=88be3492dc9cff1aa09e65a8c1597ee4", "link": "/anime/4053/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament_Finals", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament Finals"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/13553.jpg?s=d06f2b8b86a279fd53a31cac855a7bdb", "link": "/anime/5751/Prince_of_Tennis__Another_Story_-_Messages_From_Past_and_Future", "name": "Prince of Tennis: Another Story -
