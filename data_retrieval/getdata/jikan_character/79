{"about": "The 22-year-old head at the main Pantasia branch, and a Harvard graduate with a Food Science diploma (there he had a girlfriend named Cathy, but they got separated when he needed to go back to Japan). His passion and talent is food tasting, at which he excels.\n \n His straight-laced, no-nonsense attitude belies his very silly quirk of making strange pun-based reactions to the delicious bread he taste-tests: He once married an extremely ugly woman just for the sake of a pun. (He then got a divorce five minutes later.) He used to be the student of Ken, but Ken drove Ryo away with his behavior.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Ryo Kuroyanagi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/33052.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/28467.jpg?s=aadb146f9087d5ff202de2fb44d644a7", "link": "/manga/653/Yakitate_Japan", "name": "Yakitate!!
