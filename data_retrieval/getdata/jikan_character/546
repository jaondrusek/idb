After testing Himeno through various means, Hayate gradually begins to accept her as the Pr&eacute;tear, eventually finding himself falling in love with her. In an attempt to watch-over and protect Himeno, Hayate takes a part time job with her father working on the mansion grounds.\n \n\n", "name": "Hayate ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/85544.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5198.jpg?s=3084486b7a95d16269628100962eb2a5", "link": "/manga/1248/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pretear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pretear"}], "member-favorites": 127, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/11709.jpg?s=7a57674adb524128ed1d74c332344b12", "link": "/anime/100/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pr\u00e9tear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pr\u00e9tear"}], "name-japanese": "(\u98af)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/24065v.jpg", "link": "/people/97/Kousuke_Toriumi", "name": "Toriumi, Kousuke", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/20771v.jpg", "link": "/people/282/Illich_Guardiola", "name": "Guardiola, Illich", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/37129v.jpg", "link": "/people/774/Simone_DAndrea", "name": "D'Andrea, Simone", "language": "Italian"}]}
