{"about": "Tatiana Wisla is the only child of \"the proud and noble\" Wisla house of Anatoray. At the age of seventeen, Tatiana left home to become a member of the newly-formed Anatoray Military Vanship Corps, a new military division dedicated to using vanships as weapons as opposed to just couriers and transports. She excelled in both piloting and dogfighting, quickly becoming one of the best vanship pilots in the sky, possibly second only to Alex Row. She sent all the extra money she made as an ace pilot back to her family so that her mother could care for her ailing father. Before too long, she found herself on the Silvana as Row's handpicked wing commander for his small vanship fighter fleet. She pilots a twin-engine vanship fighter which she painted red to distinguish herself from the other pilots as well as all other vanships in the sky.\n \n Tatiana is second best to no one in her own mind, but her overconfident self-view is challenged when she meets Claus, whose piloting skills rival her own. From then on, her feelings toward Claus go on a roller coaster, making her feel anger, disgust, awe, respect, fear, and even attraction to the young vanship pilot. Her frosty aloofness is clearly a self-defensive fa\u00e7ade; she suffers a mental breakdown of sorts after getting shot down over the desert, but recovers, and from that time she begins to show a greater depth of feeling, especially towards Claus, whom she develops a crush on.\n \n In \"Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam\" she is the commander of the Reaper Ship Sylvius and assigns Fam and Giselle, after they have failed to hijack the Sylvius, to capture fifteen ships of the Ades Federation, to buy back their freedom.\n\n", "name": "Tatiana Wis\u0142a", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/85908.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/86893.jpg?s=11e42909d4666bf5fc4d9a66981b15b9", "link": "/manga/27497/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam", "name": "Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/86899.jpg?s=df8bf7bdd3144af253c16f3e0cf60e74", "link": "/manga/30207/Last_Exile__Sunadokei_no_Tabibito", "name": "Last Exile: Sunadokei no Tabibito"}], "member-favorites": 40, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/10888.jpg?s=84519ac4b681417631ec4188ddf5c4f8", "link": "/anime/97/Last_Exile", "name": "Last Exile"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/33541.jpg?s=c26e4725398cabb822637a27ce17b098", "link": "/anime/10336/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam", "name": "Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/34925.jpg?s=9a0fd2b3909d159d2a7d61c027d48621", "link": "/anime/12429/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam_Recaps", "name": "Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam Recaps"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30bf\u30c1\u30a2\u30ca\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30b9\u30e9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/14799v.jpg", "link": "/people/85/Michelle_Ruff", "name": "Ruff, Michelle", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/50751v.jpg", "link": "/people/413/Eri_Kitamura", "name": "Kitamura, Eri", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/7291v.jpg", "link": "/people/661/Clarine_Harp", "name": "Harp, Clarine", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/45816/Kordula_Lei\u00dfe", "name": "Lei\u00dfe, Kordula", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49709v.jpg", "link": "/people/45991/Maria_Rosa_Guill\u00e9n", "name": "Guill\u00e9n, Maria Rosa", "language": "Spanish"}]}
