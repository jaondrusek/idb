{"about": "Age: unknown Over 150 yearsHeight: 180 cm (5'11\")\n Weight: 81.6 kg (180 lb)\n \n Vash displays two different personalities. Vash usually exaggerates foolish characteristics to make people feel unthreatened and to hide his identity; for instance, exhibiting an almost obsessive love of doughnuts and at one point introduced himself as \"Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Pierre Andri Charton-Haymoss Ivanovich Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III.\" Vash's reputation as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\" is legendary, as is the damage and destruction associated with his presence. However, when those around him are threatened, Vash shows complete focus and control.\n \n Vash is a very multidimensional character&mdash;quite literally a walking contradiction. He is often a womanizer, and other times a gentleman. Sometimes he is a coward, yet other times he shows great courage. He is a wanted man, yet he wouldn't hurt a fly. \n \n Despite his age, he still hasn't found peace with himself. A point of conflict in the series are the inner differences between Vash and Millions Knives, his twin brother, and their regard for humanity. Though Vash and Knives have gone through the same experience and torment, Vash chooses to remain hopeful and loving toward humanity, where as Knives has fallen into a deep-seated hatred of their race. Their personalities also have key differences: Vash cannot stand the despair of being alone, whereas Knives revels in his loneliness and has no desire for any company.\n \n Because Vash refuses to kill any of his opponents, he often suffers at the hands of very persistent enemies and their attempts at revenge. As a result, his body is a patchwork of large scars, chunks of missing flesh supported by metal mesh, and stitch marks.\n\n", "name": "Vash the Stampede ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/89607.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/153055.jpg?s=ab22cff0c242b64d9795f8fb4369ab67", "link": "/manga/703/Trigun", "name": "Trigun"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/55331.jpg?s=2c2eddba1fb67b6106366d5365bef000", "link": "/manga/704/Trigun_Maximum", "name": "Trigun Maximum"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/86599.jpg?s=658c7800ce2357be9bd96fe8594c13ee", "link": "/manga/44357/Trigun__Multiple_Bullets", "name": "Trigun: Multiple Bullets"}], "member-favorites": 10497, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/20310.jpg?s=afac384a8aea49c363b0caa5e968a2fe", "link": "/anime/6/Trigun", "name": "Trigun"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/27969.jpg?s=f20365591e82318f4860553ad2c79174", "link": "/anime/4106/Trigun__Badlands_Rumble", "name": "Trigun: Badlands Rumble"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30f4\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49718v.jpg", "link": "/people/10/Johnny_Yong_Bosch", "name": "Bosch, Johnny Yong", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/14617v.jpg", "link": "/people/173/Masaya_Onosaka", "name": "Onosaka, Masaya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/24333v.jpg", "link": "/people/344/Kouki_Miyata", "name": "Miyata, Kouki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/29853v.jpg", "link": "/people/732/Bryce_Papenbrook", "name": "Papenbrook, Bryce", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1080v.jpg", "link": "/people/1025/Bruno_Magne", "name": "Magne, Bruno", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42291v.jpg", "link": "/people/1694/Stephan_Schleberger", "name": "Schleberger, Stephan", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/22297v.jpg", "link": "/people/6868/Flavio_Aquilone", "name": "Aquilone, Flavio", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/4986v.jpg", "link": "/people/7752/Simone_Mori", "name": "Mori, Simone", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39244v.jpg", "link": "/people/7787/Zolt\u00e1n_Juh\u00e1sz", "name": "Juh\u00e1sz, Zolt\u00e1n", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15289v.jpg", "link": "/people/14753/Su_Jin_Kang", "name": "Kang, Su Jin", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/18871/Marjolaine_Poulain", "name": "Poulain, Marjolaine", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/25573v.jpg", "link": "/people/22477/Gabriel_Ortiz", "name": "Ortiz, Gabriel", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40118v.jpg", "link": "/people/37942/Nacho_De_Porrata", "name": "De Porrata, Nacho", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42311v.jpg", "link": "/people/39456/Luiz_S\u00e9rgio_Vieira", "name": "Vieira, Luiz S\u00e9rgio", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42345v.jpg", "link": "/people/40348/Alexandre_Moreno", "name": "Moreno, Alexandre", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/45858/Norman_Matt", "name": "Matt, Norman", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49479v.jpg", "link": "/people/45980/David_Jenner_Husson", "name": "Jenner Husson, David", "language": "Spanish"}]}
