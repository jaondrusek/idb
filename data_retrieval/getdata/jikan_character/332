While his play style becomes more aggressive as the series progresses, his original style is still evident in his matches.\n \n <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Background</b></div>\n \n Kaid\u014d is mostly known for his \"Snake Shot\" (derived from the \"Buggy Whip Shot\"), a curving forehand that keeps his opponents running. He later develops the \"Boomerang Snake,\" which is a shot that swerves out of bounds, around the net pole, and back in bounds. He developed the shot under mentor Sadaharu Inui's advice and by working with him in doubles. He usually plays the Singles 3 position, though he is most often placed in one of the Doubles slots.\n \n In Genius 379, the last chapter of the manga, Kaid\u014d is seen as a third year and the new captain of Seigaku, with Momoshiro as his sub-captain. Their rivalry has, apparently, somewhat mellowed with time.\n As akid he cried a lot. When he was in kindergarten, he was often mistaken for a girl, called Kaoru-chan, and forced to wear a skirt.\n \n (Source: Kuryujiru LJ and Prince of Tennis Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Kaoru Kaidou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/57616.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/153238.jpg?s=ff21d030366ef2514d0912e0ff66227a", "link": "/manga/49/Tennis_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Tennis no Ouji-sama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/109185.jpg?s=6b435bea2a6ddd9d8ccc99317107a8d9", "link": "/manga/11153/Houkago_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Houkago no Ouji-sama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/153234.jpg?s=83a99edcf903661f9eee35653c80841d", "link": "/manga/12965/Shin_Tennis_no_Ouji-sama", "name": "Shin Tennis no Ouji-sama"}], "member-favorites": 184, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/21624.jpg?s=7ff8f45bd04135e5f2aefdc2f25bfb0d", "link": "/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis", "name": "Prince of Tennis"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/6381.jpg?s=38c383dc9a048ade66485539079e8bff", "link": "/anime/814/Prince_of_Tennis__Atobes_Gift", "name": "Prince of Tennis: Atobe's Gift"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/3945.jpg?s=9fe19ca6946832ba12b92221106b20c6", "link": "/anime/815/Prince_of_Tennis__The_Two_Samurai_The_First_Game", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The Two Samurai, The First Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/10572.jpg?s=8af0a90724a3699db8d7d90011e264a3", "link": "/anime/995/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/4471.jpg?s=2a84683e3aa6c468a95c62a1b2ac69f7", "link": "/anime/1190/Prince_of_Tennis__A_Day_on_Survival_Mountain", "name": "Prince of Tennis: A Day on Survival Mountain"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/3713.jpg?s=bf97a1e2f48fb1e40afaf402e2f4ebc6", "link": "/anime/2752/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament_Semifinals", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament Semifinals"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/7525.jpg?s=88be3492dc9cff1aa09e65a8c1597ee4", "link": "/anime/4053/Prince_of_Tennis__The_National_Tournament_Finals", "name": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament Finals"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/13553.jpg?s=d06f2b8b86a279fd53a31cac855a7bdb", "link": "/anime/5751/Prince_of_Tennis__Another_Story_-_Messages_From_Past_and_Future", "name": "Prince of Tennis: Another Story -
