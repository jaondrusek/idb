{"about": "Aina Sahalim is one of the main characters in the anime OVA Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team. \"Sahalin\" is a Japanese transliteration of Sakhalin (\u30b5\u30cf\u30ea\u30f3).\n \n Aina is Ginias' sister and a daughter of the Zeonic noble family Sahalin. She is an ace pilot, but she shows concern for her soldiers' lives. Sahalin family friend Captain Norris Packard acts as a surrogate father for the young Aina at the base looking out for her. Although she's technically only a test pilot for most of the series, only Ginias outranks her at the Zeon base. She also looks up to Norris Packard as a father figure.\n\n", "name": "Aina Sahalin", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/90176.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 26, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75618.jpg?s=dc5ee970c8aa429b15630fcccd1c3599", "link": "/anime/81/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__The_08th_MS_Team", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/16057.jpg?s=37e911cc71a9d8d593a9781264c2c9ee", "link": "/anime/83/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__The_08th_MS_Team_-_Millers_Report", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Miller's Report"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30a4\u30ca\u30fb\u30b5\u30cf\u30ea\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/35155v.jpg", "link": "/people/195/Kikuko_Inoue", "name": "Inoue, Kikuko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40609v.jpg", "link": "/people/15295/Emilie_Brown", "name": "Brown, Emilie", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16929v.jpg", "link": "/people/15593/Mun_Ja_Choi", "name": "Choi, Mun Ja", "language": "Korean"}]}
