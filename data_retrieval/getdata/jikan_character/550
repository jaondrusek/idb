{"about": "Mannen is the Knight of Ice and is the leader of the younger members of the Leafe Knights. Mannen often comes up with clever ideas to solve the Leafe Knight's problems, including using Shin as bait to find the Pretear. The older Knights usually get mad at him and claim that he's too young to help majorly, which only drives Mannen to disobey them more. With his two followers, Hajime and Shin, Mannen died while fighting the Princess of Disaster sixteen years ago and came back as a child. \n \n\n", "name": "Mannen ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/51320.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5198.jpg?s=3084486b7a95d16269628100962eb2a5", "link": "/manga/1248/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pretear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pretear"}], "member-favorites": 11, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/11709.jpg?s=7a57674adb524128ed1d74c332344b12", "link": "/anime/100/Shin_Shirayuki-hime_Densetsu_Pr\u00e9tear", "name": "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pr\u00e9tear"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e07\u5e74)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/33521v.jpg", "link": "/people/148/Akiko_Yajima", "name": "Yajima, Akiko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/12455v.jpg", "link": "/people/192/Greg_Ayres", "name": "Ayres, Greg", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16891v.jpg", "link": "/people/15567/Gabriele_Patriarca", "name": "Patriarca, Gabriele", "language": "Italian"}]}
