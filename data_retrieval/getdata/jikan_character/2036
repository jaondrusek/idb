She traveled across the country with a band of singers, until she was adopted by Ricardo Hendric, a demon tamer who wanted to use her powers to revive his dead wife Melda. She was rescued by Rosette and Chrno and was taken in by the Magdalan Order for her protection. She is a kind and sweet girl, who looks up to Rosette and is good friends with Chrno, not really caring  that he is demon. Since the supernatural powers she has have always been a real source of despair for her, and the cause of many tragedies in her life, she has grown to be a very weak, submissive girl, afraid to fight for herself. Meeting Rosette and Chrno was a turning point in her life, and she is determined to change and become a brave person like Rosette, who she really admires. Despite being only 12, she is very mature, and usually helps her best friends to get along with each other. Has a very beautiful soprano voice that has the ability of healing people. She is one of the 7 heavenly apostles; she is the apostle of charity.\n\n", "name": "Azmaria Hendric", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/33364.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/178875.jpg?s=2252886d521303d25e7ff87aef232e9a", "link": "/manga/338/Chrno_Crusade", "name": "Chrno Crusade"}], "member-favorites": 114, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/14141.jpg?s=6a9cf7bb34cd07de79eac98b24c83604", "link": "/anime/60/Chrno_Crusade", "name": "Chrno Crusade"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/10060.jpg?s=712c3b8a8ae0eea7897651a1cb2b9c39", "link": "/anime/4450/Chrno_Crusade__Az_demo_Wakaru_Chrno_Crusade_Kouza", "name": "Chrno Crusade: Az demo Wakaru Chrno Crusade Kouza"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30ba\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30d8\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30c3\u30af)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/12625v.jpg", "link": "/people/135/Saeko_Chiba", "name": "Chiba, Saeko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49367v.jpg", "link": "/people/199/Jessica_Boone", "name": "Boone, Jessica", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/1633/Marine_Bargy", "name": "Bargy, Marine", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/5197v.jpg", "link": "/people/6106/Rubina_Kuraoka", "name": "Kuraoka, Rubina", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40705v.jpg", "link": "/people/7861/Andrea_Laudon", "name": "Laudon, Andrea", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15317v.jpg", "link": "/people/14769/Min_Jeong_Yeo", "name": "Yeo, Min Jeong", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/46584v.jpg", "link": "/people/42870/Daniela_Fava", "name": "Fava, Daniela", "language": "Italian"}]}
