And to add to their woes, Spike ends up mysteriously on the police's most wanted list, either the butt of a joke or the victim of a severe computer glitch. But what's worse, being targeted by every bounty hunter in the solar system, or taking on a kid-genius, a genius puppy and a genus: fatale, species: femme as part of the crew. Well, if Scorpion or the Dragon Head Family doesn't kill them, the extra mouths to feed certainly will.
