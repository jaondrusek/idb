Her accent tends to fluctuate, but her acting is actually quite good. It's a grossly underrated vocal performance, and is superior to her voice work in STEAMBOY, in which she strains her voice too much to sound like a boy. Even still, there's no denying that Paquin is a fine actress. She now appears in HBO series, True Blood."}
