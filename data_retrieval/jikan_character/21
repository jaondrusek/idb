{"about": "Nickname: Mori\n Birthday: May 5\n Age: 18\n Known relatives: Mitsukuni Haninozuka (cousin), Satoshi Morinozuka (younger brother)\n Sign: Taurus\n Height: 192 cm (6&#039;4\")\n Blood Type: O\n School: Ouran High School\n Grade: Third Year, Class A\n Status: Wealthy Lineage\n Host type: \"Strong but silent\"\n Nationality: Japanese\n Favorite Subjects: Geography, Japanese History\n Favorite Foods: Oriental (like fermented natto soybeans)\n Rose Color: dark blue\n \n Takashi Morinozuka (a.k.a. Mori-sempai) is a tall, stoic, but kind upperclassman who is Honey-senpai&#039;s constant companion. The Morinozuka family had protected and served the Haninozuka family for many generations but marriage joined the families two generations ago, breaking the master-servant tradition. Despite that, Mori still faithfully protects Honey and attends to his wishes. His protectiveness extends to his classmates and fellow host club members, gaining him a certain level of respect. He does not talk very much and is considered the \"wild\" (\"strong and silent\" in the dub) type. However, when he is tired, he becomes uncharacteristically talkative and flirtatious. Mori&#039;s hobbies include kendo and karate. He&#039;s the only member of the Host Club to call Honey-senpai by his first name.\n \n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n", "name": "Takashi Morinozuka", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/128685.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/19240.jpg?s=8b4e16c145de8d076de1e7a522f73252", "link": "/manga/30/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33182.jpg?s=16a536c8097bc213d65d6909933da9c0", "link": "/manga/20777/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/39258.jpg?s=740f334574cfcccebe6ee3759e5262f2", "link": "/manga/24339/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_Short_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club Short Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/59387.jpg?s=a1eb51dff2dab27b13cb812a81763734", "link": "/manga/27029/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_University_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club University Special"}], "member-favorites": 901, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/71992.jpg?s=721d5f3166e936ee69187e4bc004f319", "link": "/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}], "name-japanese": "(\u929b\u4e4b\u585a \u5d07)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/25447v.jpg", "link": "/people/26/Travis_Willingham", "name": "Willingham, Travis", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/12860v.jpg", "link": "/people/114/Daisuke_Kirii", "name": "Kirii, Daisuke", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15759v.jpg", "link": "/people/14819/Seung_jun_Kim", "name": "Kim, Seung jun", "language": "Korean"}]}
