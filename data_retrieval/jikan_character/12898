{"about": "Paul von Oberstein is a captain serving as chief of staff in fortress Iserlohn of the Galactic Empire. He was born blind and has to wear artificial eyes to see. He has nothing but contempt for his incompetent commander and despises the high nobles, realizing fully well the decadence of the Goldenbaum dynasty and how ignorant they are of the common people&#039;s plight. If he himself had been born a few years earlier, when the \"inferior genes exclusion law\" was still in effect, he would have been discarded as dangerous to the species. Because of that and realizing Reinhard&#039;s abilities, he wants to join his camp.\n \n Oberstein is a genius strategist and organizer, both in war and politics. Calm and composed, he never shows any sign of emotional distress, everything he says and does is part of a well thought, reasonable plan.\n\n", "name": "Paul von Oberstein", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/131297.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/155231.jpg?s=f59e290a1bb87982d826e032f77a2940", "link": "/manga/6978/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu", "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/40341.jpg?s=b9271dca155e790518c59a999f012362", "link": "/manga/11941/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu", "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu"}], "member-favorites": 728, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/13225.jpg?s=da6389dc5a5a11d37159f9c840a0a5ed", "link": "/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu", "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/51345.jpg?s=0ea6d1e45ee25a691bb9954c9b81c1dc", "link": "/anime/3014/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu__Waga_Yuku_wa_Hoshi_no_Taikai", "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Waga Yuku wa Hoshi no Taikai"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d1\u30a6\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12357v.jpg", "link": "/people/424/Kaneto_Shiozawa", "name": "Shiozawa, Kaneto", "language": "Japanese"}]}
