{"about": "A traumatized boy who lives a hermit's existence in his room and does not go to school after cracking under the pressure of entrance exams. He spends a lot of time in front of his computer, and has a hobby of ordering things from the Internet\u2014mostly fake magical or occultic implements\u2014and then returning them before he has to pay, for the thrill of receiving something ridiculously stupid. He is also interested in cars and collects miniature versions of them. When he comes into possession of Shinku and winds her up, he is unwillingly caught in the crossfire of the Alice Game\u2014Shinku declares him to be her \"servant\" and demands that he obey her at all times. Jun is extremely skilled at crafts and at sewing. Although he is arrogant, and occasionally cold and rude, he cares for others but typically refuses to let his feelings show. He is especially friendly with Hina Ichigo, and at times, blushes around Shinku, which portrays that he cares deeply for her.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Jun Sakurada", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/89702.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/169707.jpg?s=b6da1c07cdba328c908acb8215d307d2", "link": "/manga/98/Rozen_Maiden", "name": "Rozen Maiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/113855.jpg?s=36357972a8a4eb8d8e0e847ddce51dc8", "link": "/manga/7728/Rozen_Maiden_2008", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2008)"}], "member-favorites": 28, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/15728.jpg?s=d32a7a33685bdc5e759b42cadc59cdd2", "link": "/anime/64/Rozen_Maiden", "name": "Rozen Maiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/10242.jpg?s=569b3ddc923bc9551843a1d445353f46", "link": "/anime/65/Rozen_Maiden__Tr\u00e4umend", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Tr\u00e4umend"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/1719.jpg?s=eb1faceb0bd7beff219f2d5b2258749c", "link": "/anime/1719/Rozen_Maiden__Ouvert\u00fcre", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Ouvert\u00fcre"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/52079.jpg?s=dff6fc156fa86b2d34d34b073162bbab", "link": "/anime/18041/Rozen_Maiden_2013", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2013)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u685c\u7530 \u30b8\u30e5\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/19885v.jpg", "link": "/people/126/Asami_Sanada", "name": "Sanada, Asami", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39414v.jpg", "link": "/people/319/Mona_Marshall", "name": "Marshall, Mona", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41312v.jpg", "link": "/people/603/Shannon_Emerick", "name": "Emerick, Shannon", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/5625v.jpg", "link": "/people/8434/Fabian_Hollwitz", "name": "Hollwitz, Fabian", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/10402v.jpg", "link": "/people/10841/Corey_Hartzog", "name": "Hartzog, Corey", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15971v.jpg", "link": "/people/15097/In_Seong_O", "name": "O, In Seong", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/38613v.jpg", "link": "/people/15743/Ryota_Osaka", "name": "Osaka, Ryota", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/24661v.jpg", "link": "/people/21493/Thierry_Janssen", "name": "Janssen, Thierry", "language": "French"}]}
