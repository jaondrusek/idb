{"about": "Sajou has short black hair, slanted eyes, and wears glasses and has been since Kindergarten. His vision is below 0.1 in both eyes. He excels at education and physics, but is bad at music. He&#039;s neutral about food, but if he had to choose he would say squid. Born as the eldest son in the end of autumn, his mother was from Kyoto and his father from Yokohama. His grandfather is a former professor of Christianity at the college and currently lives in New Zealand. His first love was when he was in first grade and it was a 6th grade boy who was the team leader of the section he was in. He is unable to cook for himself.\n\n", "name": "Rihito Sajou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/92106.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/12994.jpg?s=fcde9fe930ba54d531669abce2967075", "link": "/manga/9699/Doukyuusei", "name": "Doukyuusei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/27839.jpg?s=f08af8ca8a28729e0b85984b0e5d245b", "link": "/manga/18200/Sotsugyousei", "name": "Sotsugyousei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/67873.jpg?s=f69440cec3c9c915bd3b0c539ed638b6", "link": "/manga/19570/Sora_to_Hara", "name": "Sora to Hara"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/114943.jpg?s=f03f4ab1858b2d8f00249e1528f877f2", "link": "/manga/39565/OB", "name": "O.B."}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/178382.jpg?s=7b51735c51bfc88a19e140d2e4076f99", "link": "/manga/98841/Dousoukai", "name": "Dousoukai"}], "member-favorites": 63, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/78606.jpg?s=1a22441ea12706fa69c1c691a7bd9a5e", "link": "/anime/30346/Doukyuusei_Movie", "name": "Doukyuusei (Movie)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4f50\u6761 \u5229\u4eba)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41532v.jpg", "link": "/people/74/Kenji_Nojima", "name": "Nojima, Kenji", "language": "Japanese"}]}
