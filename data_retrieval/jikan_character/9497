{"about": "In the TV anime <i>Gundam</i> (Universal Century series) universe, Mineva Lao Zabi is the last surviving member of the Zabi family and heir to the Principality of Zeon; she is the daughter of Dozle Zabi and Zenna Zabi.\n \n <b>Mobile Suit Gundam/Zeta Gundam/Gundam ZZ</b>\n Mineva was born during the One Year War. During the Federation siege on the space fortress Solomon, Dozle insisted that Zenna took the young Mineva and flee to the Zeon&#039;s Axis base in the asteroid belt. Zenna later died, leaving the young princess in the hands of Maharajah Karn; Haman Karn took over as regent for her father after his death, guiding Mineva until she was ready to take over. At the conclusion of the 1st Neo-Zeon War, the Mineva found by the AEUG declares herself a fake&mdash;however, as there was never a hint of this before, it can be assumed it&#039;s the real Mineva lying in order to be no longer embroiled in the continued Zeon-Earth conflicts as either a puppet of Zeon, or a person marked for death by Earth extremists.
