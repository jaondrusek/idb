{"about": "Jet was originally 001, but was replaced by Ivan. Jet comes from New York City in the United States and was the leader of the Jets gang in New York&#039;s West Side. (In the manga, his character is introduced in a scene that parodies the opening scenes of the movie West Side Story). During a fight with the Puerto Rican Sharks gang, Jet stabs one of the rival gang members to death, causing the others to run away in order to escape the police. Jet, however, was intercepted by Black Ghost members, who took him away from the scene to be made into a cyborg later. Jet, true to his name, has boosters built into his feet, allowing him to fly at speeds of up to Mach 5. 002 is also equipped with an early form of acceleration module, later refined in 009. He has a brash personality that often conflicts with his peers (in the 2001 series he&#039;s even hostile towards them at some points), but is nonetheless a loyal and good-hearted member of the team. He was one of the 00 Cyborgs who were frozen until more advanced technology and procedures were developed. Chronologically, he is in his 40/50s, since he was 18 years old when captured. Jet has a huge nose.\n\n", "name": "Jet Link", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/112970.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image":
