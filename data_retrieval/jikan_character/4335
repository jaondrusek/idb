{"about": "Age: 20-21\n Birthday: February 10 (Aquarius)\n Height: 190 cm\n Blood type: A\n \n Ren is, in outward appearances, an extremely nice and polite star; however, he shows his true self whenever he is around Kyouko. At the age of twenty, Ren has lived a large portion of his life in America. After Ren's encounter with Reino (from Vie Ghoul), it is revealed that \"Tsuruga Ren\" is only a stage name with his real name being Kuon Hizuri.\n \n Ren harbors what he thinks is an unrequited love for Kyouko. Because of his past as Kuon, he does not believe he has the right to be happy. He also had a long period of denial for his feelings because of the age difference.\n \n Kuon met Kyouko when they were young at a creek behind the ryoukan that the Fuwas owned. Kyouko is not yet aware that Tsuruga Ren, Kuon Hizuri, and her \"fairy-prince Corn\" are the same person.\n \n When Kuon tried to begin his acting career in America, he was unable to escape from the shadow of his father, Hizuri Kuu or Shuhei Hozu. Often his performance would be inadequate and he would often be fired. Takarada Lory, a family friend, offers Ren an opportunity to leave his identity behind to become Tsuruga Ren.\n \n In Ren&rsquo;s past he was constantly picked on or bullied by Americans for being mixed with Japanese and Russian and his friend Rick helped him in these instances, but one day when he was being beat up he turned into evil Kuon when he had enough and decided to use martial arts to hurt people. Rick came to help him, but instead told him to catch himself while one of the bullies that he beat up ran away and Rick&rsquo;s girlfriend was pushed into the road while a car was speeding, so Rick ran to save her but the car couldn't stop so Rick was ran over and killed. Tina blamed the instance on Kuon by calling him a &ldquo;MURDERER&rdquo; so Ren made a promise to never revert back to those ways and to never have happiness again. He also uses his watch which stopped at an odd time of 2:13 and calls it handcuffs in order to remind him of what occurred in the past and to remember the promise he made.\n\n", "name": "Ren Tsuruga", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/59129.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/26110.jpg?s=91f4e5984d38c801173e2b61dfe050c6", "link": "/manga/610/Skip_Beat", "name": "Skip Beat!"}], "member-favorites": 1664, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/84022.jpg?s=45aa8eb632695ba2867ee58741d17709", "link": "/anime/4722/Skip_Beat", "name": "Skip Beat!"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6566\u8cc0 \u84ee / \u4e45\u9060 \u30d2\u30ba\u308a)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42160v.jpg", "link": "/people/20/Katsuyuki_Konishi", "name": "Konishi, Katsuyuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42942v.jpg", "link": "/people/32927/Robbie_Daymond", "name": "Daymond, Robbie", "language": "English"}]}
