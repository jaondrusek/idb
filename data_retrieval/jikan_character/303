She can also see past events that happened to, or around, an item or place and uses this power when examining evidence or crime scenes. Miho gives Robin advice on how to improve control over her power and also acts as her mentor.\n\n", "name": "Miho Karasuma", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/52109.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 3, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/25527.jpg?s=24a4b969a074d38978b99bafed550252", "link": "/anime/7/Witch_Hunter_Robin", "name": "Witch Hunter Robin"}], "name-japanese": "(\u70cf\u4e38\u7f8e\u7a42)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/35525v.jpg", "link": "/people/36/Wendee_Lee", "name": "Lee, Wendee", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/43810v.jpg", "link": "/people/1474/Kaho_Kouda", "name": "Kouda, Kaho", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42388v.jpg", "link": "/people/9916/Kathrin_Gaube", "name": "Gaube, Kathrin", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28727v.jpg", "link": "/people/26569/Chantal_Baroin", "name": "Baroin, Chantal", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/43066/Loredana_Nicosia", "name": "Nicosia, Loredana", "language": "Italian"}]}
