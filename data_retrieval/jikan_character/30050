He is the editor-in-chief of the Emerald department at Marukawa, and is sometimes referred to as \"the Capable.\" He and Ritsu were once in a brief relationship in high school but split up over a misunderstanding, where they both thought each other was wrong. It is revealed that he later had a break down from the break up, family problems, and other personal issues, which in turn left him with an unrequited love for Ritsu. When both he and Ritsu realize who each other are, he promises Ritsu he will make him fall in love with him again much to Ritsu&#039;s contempt.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Masamune Takano", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/133973.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/14369.jpg?s=e251f4583ed9927114090babbfcca515", "link": "/manga/10573/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Onodera_Ritsu_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Onodera Ritsu no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/44313.jpg?s=e47b99a4ad9f5ee49d20b983dfa22ece", "link": "/manga/26224/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yoshino_Chiaki_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yoshino Chiaki no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/81400.jpg?s=49f8ab1e46a83b091cc97d7b1632eef2", "link": "/manga/31105/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}], "member-favorites": 1171, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/35863.jpg?s=79e32a75581f0b42777ff50ec311cec2", "link": "/anime/8063/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_OVA", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi OVA"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/29763.jpg?s=62c940272d145be1beb8cc2e524c1fc8", "link": "/anime/9926/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/34871.jpg?s=4446ddce68f9b3002d41525c5482aaa1", "link": "/anime/11123/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_2", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/65927.jpg?s=9e47a5b2c7f469e9990a4ca5f202ae8a", "link": "/anime/20371/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_Movie__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi Movie: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/55723.jpg?s=caa44a790ff16b409b6f3b008d957782", "link": "/anime/20815/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Valentine-hen", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Valentine-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u9ad8\u91ce\u653f\u5b97)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42160v.jpg", "link": "/people/20/Katsuyuki_Konishi", "name": "Konishi, Katsuyuki", "language": "Japanese"}]}
