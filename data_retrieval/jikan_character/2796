{"about": "Alvis Hamilton is a peculiar eleven-year-old child and \"the cargo.\" Alvis (or \"Al\") is targeted by the Guild and it becomes apparent that she is the \"key to Exile.\" Her nurse, Guita, and the pilot who was commissioned to transport her, Ralph Wednesday, were killed as a result of the Guild's pursuit. Claus Valca tended to Ralph when he crash landed and that's how they met Al. Ralph knew he was going to die and asked Claus to take his dangerous mission in delivering Al to the Silvana. While Ralph distracted the Guild pilot with his engine, Claus and Lavie drifted downstream with their Vanship and Ralph self detonates his ship to save the three of them.\n\n", "name": "Alvis E.
