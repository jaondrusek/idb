{"about": "She is a bio-android created by Professor Gwen Khan using ancient biotechnology found within the Grave of the Dragon ruins. The complexity of the information was so vast that even a great mind like his couldn&#039;t understand it all. Sometime after she was created, both Melfina and the Outlaw Star were stolen from the Kei pirates by the outlaw Hilda who intended to use them to find the Galactic Leyline. Melfina&#039;s appearance is of a petite and slender young woman with shoulder length black hair and large brown eyes. While her physical age appears to be 17, her real age is that of only 2. She has no recollection of her past or why she was created, which very often troubles her throughout the series.\n\n", "name": "Melfina ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/52330.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/10168.jpg?s=b9039387e7bcb6f8b94b37c27abae9f5", "link": "/manga/7438/Outlaw_Star", "name": "Outlaw Star"}], "member-favorites": 91, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/28848.jpg?s=0b564d49d00c6e0b28c6715871b60900", "link": "/anime/400/Seihou_Bukyou_Outlaw_Star", "name": "Seihou Bukyou Outlaw Star"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/81082.jpg?s=9121d86d4699bfe585f586c3a0e92276", "link": "/anime/33713/Seihou_Bukyou_Outlaw_Star_Specials", "name": "Seihou Bukyou Outlaw Star Specials"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e1\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30ca)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49118v.jpg", "link": "/people/13/Ayako_Kawasumi", "name": "Kawasumi, Ayako", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40609v.jpg", "link": "/people/15295/Emilie_Brown", "name": "Brown, Emilie", "language": "English"}]}
