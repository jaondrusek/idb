During this period, he returned home several times, but because his family couldn&#039;t accept the fact that he became a professional Glory player, it resulted in him being on bad terms with them.\n \n The year when Ye Xiu left his house (on December 3rd) was when Glory was first released to the public. Ye Xiu was the defending No.1 player on the leaderboards, his account ID \"One Autumn Leaf\" being one of the first to achieve total victory in Glory&#039;s tournament and to become a gaming celebrity. After a few years, he became an influential figure in Glory. When Glory organized the first season of the professional league tournament, Ye Xiu took his twin brother&#039;s identity card to register as a professional player because he left his family and thus didn&#039;t have one. Since then, he became Glory&#039;s No.1 Battle God (God of Fighting) at the game&#039;s peak. In addition, because he mastered every profession, Ye Xiu is called \"Glory\" himself.\n (Source: Baidu)\n\n", "name": "Xiu Ye", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/327643.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 669, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/81892.jpg?s=a36b695870c48285f96f122414384d6e", "link": "/anime/33926/Quanzhi_Gaoshou", "name": "Quanzhi Gaoshou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u53f6 \u4fee)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49897v.jpg", "link": "/people/46317/Jie_Zhang", "name": "Zhang, Jie", "language": "Mandarin"}]}
