{"about": "Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is \"Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect\" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.\n \n It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa&#039;s and Seita&#039;s New Year&#039;s cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine&#039;s Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn&#039;t quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, \"When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don&#039;t shake up my feelings any further.\"\n\n", "name": "Tsukuyo ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/115534.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/143121.jpg?s=2bfa1141314ad18b82757909e03f3a56", "link": "/manga/44/Gintama", "name": "Gintama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/160222.jpg?s=0ca9d692eff90bdb77e55d1b4453db7e", "link": "/manga/91209/Gekijouban_Gintama__Kanketsu-hen_-_Yorozuya_yo_Eien_Nare", "name": "Gekijouban Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare"}], "member-favorites": 1199, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/10038.jpg?s=7ae9817b69ef32537c56204f6a1c2b17", "link": "/anime/918/Gintama", "name": "Gintama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/50361.jpg?s=57d536f1fae272242c8937cc60a5e61c", "link": "/anime/9969/Gintama", "name": "Gintama'"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/51723.jpg?s=7fc14418f30df831660f95f66d618fe6", "link": "/anime/15335/Gintama_Movie_2__Kanketsu-hen_-_Yorozuya_yo_Eien_Nare", "name": "Gintama Movie 2: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/75172.jpg?s=4b96852ab3290649177e72315684f47d", "link": "/anime/15417/Gintama__Enchousen", "name": "Gintama': Enchousen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/72078.jpg?s=b09fee547c3979a6c30993ff35c10175", "link": "/anime/28977/Gintama\u00b0", "name": "Gintama\u00b0"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/79704.jpg?s=3e522336836e0c43c8e08b2fd8b0f172", "link": "/anime/32366/Gintama\u00b0__Aizome_Kaori-hen", "name": "Gintama\u00b0: Aizome Kaori-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6708\u8a60)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32929v.jpg", "link": "/people/428/Yuuko_Kaida", "name": "Kaida, Yuuko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16605v.jpg", "link": "/people/1052/Takanori_Hoshino", "name": "Hoshino, Takanori", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39601v.jpg", "link": "/people/37653/Simona_Pahl", "name": "Pahl, Simona", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/44284/Marlie_Collins", "name": "Collins, Marlie", "language": "English"}]}
