{"about": "Hana is a 19-year-old college student that falls deeply in love with a wolf-man that she encounters in class one day. They start dating, and even though he tells her one night about his true nature, Hana does not seem to mind, getting married to him and eventually, giving birth to his daughter, Yuki, and one year later, to his son, Ame.\n \n Sadly, the wolf-man dies unexpectedly, leaving Hana and their wolf-children alone. Hana is scared of people finding the truth about her children, so she decides to leave the city for a rural town, starting a new life there, full of new experiences for her and especially Ame and Yuki.\n\n", "name": "Hana ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/161461.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/165496.jpg?s=df052e92d5d4c4bdfaef249d40298243", "link": "/manga/40761/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki", "name": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"}], "member-favorites": 786, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/35721.jpg?s=c4248ac158d12653f67e3a0d67dc3194", "link": "/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki", "name": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"}], "name-japanese": "(\u82b1)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/30191v.jpg", "link": "/people/472/Colleen_Clinkenbeard", "name": "Clinkenbeard, Colleen", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49681v.jpg", "link": "/people/1055/Aoi_Miyazaki", "name": "Miyazaki, Aoi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/4983v.jpg", "link": "/people/1182/Antonella_Baldini", "name": "Baldini, Antonella", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/22682v.jpg", "link": "/people/19958/Gundi_Eberhard", "name": "Eberhard, Gundi", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48033v.jpg", "link": "/people/44542/Alessandra_Carneiro", "name": "Carneiro, Alessandra", "language": "Brazilian"}]}
