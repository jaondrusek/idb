{"about": "Card type: Cool Idol\n Age: 15\n Birthday: August 10\n Zodiac sign: Leo\n Hometown: Tokyo\n Height: 165 cm\n Weight: 44 kg\n Blood type: B\n BWH: 80-56-81\n Hobbies: walking dogs\n \n With her sleek black hair and her imposing school uniform, Shibuya Rin is a cool and trendy schoolgirl. She lives in a flower shop, where she&rsquo;ll occasionally help her parents over the counter. Though her aloof demeanor makes her seem like the type of person that&rsquo;s hard to approach, Rin shows a more honest side once she&rsquo;s more trusting of others.\n \n Her rise in popularity and her being the first one to go from a tutorial idol to getting a CD debut has earned quite a bit of popularity, becoming sort of the poster girl for the Cinderella Girls.\n \n Rin tends to be the &ldquo;straight man&rdquo; in joke sequences, and is sometimes overly serious to a comedic point. While she tends to be cool and harsh, she does have a sweet side that she occasionally shows others. She is self-conscious that her default expression comes off as unfriendly. Her cool, level-headed demeanor is put to the test when she&#039;s stuck in the same room as Ranko Kanzaki, Kaede Takagaki and Riina Tada.\n \n (Source: iDOLM@STER Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Rin Shibuya", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/323626.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/120159.jpg?s=b45c081f351702e2128f74495561ebc4", "link": "/manga/42333/The_iDOLMSTER_Cinderella_Girls__Shuffle_Comic_Anthology", "name": "The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: Shuffle!!
