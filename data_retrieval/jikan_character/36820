{"about": "Name meaning: Great Shine of the Blue Peak\n Birthday: August 31\n Age: 16\n Height: 192 cm (6&#039;3 &frac12;&#039;&#039;)\n Weight: 85 kg\n Blood type: B\n Zodiac: Virgo\n School: Teiko (formerly), Touou Academy (currently)\n Favorite food: Teriyaki burger\n Hobby: looking up gravure/gravure idols\n Number: #6 (Teiko), #5 (Touou)\n Position: Power Forward\n Talents: Skill and Agility, Unusual Speed, Formless Shots, Freestyle Basketball, Zone Play\n \n Aomine was the ace of Teikou&#039;s team, embracing an aggressive and liquid style, made even more powerful by Kuroko&#039;s misdirection. In fact, Aomine was once Kuroko&#039;s \"Light,\" before Kagami. Incredibly fast and versatile, Aomine&#039;s strength lies in his unpredictability, as well as an uncanny ability to shoot from virtually any position.\n \n In his second year in middle school, Aomine inspired Kise to play basketball and he became his training partner. Kise was still a complete rookie, apart from his copying ability, and Aomine was obviously stronger than him, but Aomine kept training with Kise, just because he loves basketball. He taught Kise a lot and became his mentor/idol. During that time, Aomine also became the ace of the team.\n \n Though he loves basketball, he has grown sardonic and unenthusiastic toward the sport, skipping practice and even arriving late for important matches. This is due to his frustration in not being able to find an opponent capable of matching his skill, and thus making him conclude that the only one that can defeat him is he himself.\n \n He and Momoi are childhood friends. Even though he doesn&#039;t show it, he&#039;s actually really fond of her, and they have a sibling-like relationship.\n\n", "name": "Daiki Aomine", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/246745.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/92071.jpg?s=e573748187bb17c86a81be7d64091d14", "link": "/manga/11652/Kuroko_no_Basket", "name": "Kuroko no Basket"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/164178.jpg?s=295de5bba419caab32516c35ac9130e5", "link": "/manga/42737/Kuroko_no_Basket__Replace", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Replace"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/163711.jpg?s=cb274337cf4575ba63f803625f9cdf12", "link": "/manga/83807/Kuroko_no_Basket__Extra_Game", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Extra Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157861.jpg?s=ac345287600280871dd098f62341253d", "link": "/manga/85900/Kuroko_no_Basket__Replace_Plus", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Replace Plus"}], "member-favorites": 5855, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/50453.jpg?s=9aac7027b3020e88dc8de37232e6e7db", "link": "/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket", "name": "Kuroko no Basket"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/42751.jpg?s=02ad88eb23c1bc096dfb336a531f0b42", "link": "/anime/15487/Kuroko_no_Basket_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/56155.jpg?s=97eb6f6c896fb3453db1a72a3b6b3f2b", "link": "/anime/16894/Kuroko_no_Basket_2nd_Season", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/76803.jpg?s=2f25c9bad67018a87d4f3b8496c57bc2", "link": "/anime/16916/Kuroko_no_Basket__Tip_Off", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Tip Off"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/46071.jpg?s=5bb152ebfc46f88532dfd5434897682c", "link": "/anime/17259/Kuroko_no_Basket__Oshaberi_Shiyokka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Shiyokka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/68055.jpg?s=325816175aec01ae07e239969e2e64d6", "link": "/anime/22125/Kuroko_no_Basket__Mou_Ikkai_Yarimasen_ka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Mou Ikkai Yarimasen ka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/59027.jpg?s=59140b951b45c2ba1676f938d1f18049", "link": "/anime/22673/Kuroko_no_Basket_2nd_Season_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/68299.jpg?s=0acd76b0c27676033c1d6189e0a38a30", "link": "/anime/24415/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/71175.jpg?s=d797bee63686521f3da7f6b303c8560a", "link": "/anime/29583/Kuroko_no_Basket__Oshaberi_Demo_Shimasen_ka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Demo Shimasen ka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/72551.jpg?s=6b435b365b5a62c2c3c0c71e9f9152b9", "link": "/anime/30311/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/77323.jpg?s=10025b6d6b660f3dc42adc50424d7124", "link": "/anime/31051/Kuroko_no_Basket__Saikou_no_Present_Desu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Saikou no Present Desu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/83106.jpg?s=58165246a17340e3a2b17e28ede3e3e9", "link": "/anime/31658/Kuroko_no_Basket__Last_Game", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Last Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/82691.jpg?s=59b5404fafc5c0c0fbda300c9ea6b0c3", "link": "/anime/32869/Kuroko_no_Basket_Movie_1__Winter_Cup_-_Kage_to_Hikari", "name": "Kuroko no Basket Movie 1: Winter Cup - Kage to Hikari"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/80728.jpg?s=efadc0d354e50b8ecd9193395c7d7c1f", "link": "/anime/32870/Kuroko_no_Basket_Movie_2__Winter_Cup_-_Namida_no_Saki_e", "name": "Kuroko no Basket Movie 2: Winter Cup - Namida no Saki e"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/80729.jpg?s=89b44eef841f760b4377fb5b8a1da48f", "link": "/anime/32871/Kuroko_no_Basket_Movie_3__Winter_Cup_-_Tobira_no_Mukou", "name": "Kuroko no Basket Movie 3: Winter Cup - Tobira no Mukou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u9752\u5cf0 \u5927\u8f1d)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44598v.jpg", "link": "/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe", "name": "Suwabe, Junichi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28777v.jpg", "link": "/people/9252/Martial_Le_Minoux", "name": "Le Minoux, Martial", "language": "French"}]}
