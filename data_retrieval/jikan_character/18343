{"about": "Age: 16 (manga), 17 (anime)\n Birthday: February 20\n Height: 162 cm (5&#039;4\")\n Blood type: A\n \n A teenage girl whose father ran out on her because of his gambling debts, she was often mocked for her poverty by her classmates. She becomes the local land god after former god Mikage transfers his position as master of the shrine over to Nanami. She begins with very little spiritual power, but works hard at balancing her godly duties with her schoolwork.\n \n Nanami is often upset when Tomoe flirts with other women. Tomoe always puts Shiitake mushrooms in Nanami&#039;s food even though he knows she hates them.\n \n Nanami falls in love with Tomoe, but is rejected by him since it is taboo for a human and a demon to be lovers. Later though, Tomoe realizes he is in love with her and that awakens his curse and his memories.\n \n Nanami is the descendant of Yukiji. When she traveled in time to save Tomoe, it was her who Tomoe was in love with instead of Yukiji. Nanami used Yukiji&#039;s name because she thought Yukiji was Tomoe&#039;s lover. Currently, Tomoe and Nanami are a couple.\n (Source: Kamisama Hajimemashita Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Nanami Momozono", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/185573.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/167521.jpg?s=e9d2b6035401932d441d0365eb6447a5", "link": "/manga/8157/Kamisama_Hajimemashita", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita"}], "member-favorites": 1092, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/85429.jpg?s=3ea3f92618856027e87160124ff8e54c", "link": "/anime/14713/Kamisama_Hajimemashita", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/56425.jpg?s=9f0c4e7dde216234ca0a44e42f43c8fa", "link": "/anime/18661/Kamisama_Hajimemashita_OVA", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita OVA"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/69187.jpg?s=6cd81c17e25363eefabbe4d89f02156c", "link": "/anime/25681/Kamisama_Hajimemashita\u25ce", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita\u25ce"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/81250.jpg?s=9c236f7abbb36a40b13ac17e6ca3486e", "link": "/anime/30709/Kamisama_Hajimemashita__Kako-hen", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita: Kako-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/83437.jpg?s=564eb98acc7574ded080a0440662159e", "link": "/anime/33323/Kamisama_Hajimemashita__Kamisama_Shiawase_ni_Naru", "name": "Kamisama Hajimemashita: Kamisama, Shiawase ni Naru"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6843\u5712 \u5948\u3005\u751f)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/24323v.jpg", "link": "/people/9526/Tia_Ballard", "name": "Ballard, Tia", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/23681v.jpg", "link": "/people/11359/Suzuko_Mimori", "name": "Mimori, Suzuko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/30759v.jpg", "link": "/people/29723/Jessica_\u00c1ngeles", "name": "\u00c1ngeles, Jessica", "language": "Spanish"}]}
