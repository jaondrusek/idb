His love of the game stems from his father who played for the Yokohama Marine Stars. Wanting nothing more than to follow in his father&#039;s footsteps, he strives to become a professional ball player. Thriving on the challenge of the mound, he puts everything into the competition. He makes friends easily, as people are drawn to his personality and his excitement of the game. \n \n After Momoko and Hideki married his name was changed to Gorou Shigeno. He initially pitched right handed, but blew out his shoulder in senior little league. In junior high school and high school, he pitches left, but continues to bat right. While he never made it to Koshien, his excellent match against the Kaido High School earned him the attention of many professional baseball team&#039;s scouts. However, he went to America and joined a Triple A team, the Memphis Bats. During the Baseball World Cup, he replaced the injured pitcher Noro, and played as an excellent closer. He used to only pitch gyroballs (\"rising fastball\"), though beginning with the Baseball World Cup, he has successfully added gyrofork (\"forkball\") to his repertoire.\n He and Kaoru Shimizu start dating in the fifth season. They marry at the end of the series and have two children in the Major Message OVA. A daughter named Izumi who is born on the day Gorou wins the World Series and a son named Daigo.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Gorou Honda", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/82370.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/185602.jpg?s=9e663c97e1d2f4d20044bc27cb139c4a", "link": "/manga/10978/Major", "name": "Major"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/157412.jpg?s=cd734d10b12b6ee59b643fbf2f89d9a3", "link": "/manga/87201/Major_2nd", "name": "Major 2nd"}], "member-favorites": 1456, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/73972.jpg?s=247e4b5cfb4f609df47299d1f96608c0", "link": "/anime/558/Major_S2", "name": "Major S2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/73973.jpg?s=ef5a8d924c7238c2ce4d9c95e48d0a07", "link": "/anime/627/Major_S1", "name": "Major S1"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/73971.jpg?s=d5406e5c31c1e6b475f327da2f3d26fe", "link": "/anime/1842/Major_S3", "name": "Major S3"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75217.jpg?s=eab87db913224b7f4b5e286c8cb8d518", "link": "/anime/3226/Major_S4", "name": "Major S4"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75218.jpg?s=e7b24adc99184dab6cd8a046cab5548e", "link": "/anime/5028/Major_S5", "name": "Major S5"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/75221.jpg?s=83a87d06d683f9a8a2af11fb99e481cb", "link": "/anime/5029/Major_Movie__Yuujou_no_Winning_Shot", "name": "Major Movie: Yuujou no Winning Shot"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/75216.jpg?s=b3c0f32367436d42d25165c399c01480", "link": "/anime/7655/Major_S6", "name": "Major S6"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/75219.jpg?s=d1fa5704c98223943876d9af497dc55a", "link": "/anime/9890/Major__Message", "name": "Major: Message"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75220.jpg?s=899b158057701b3befc1c313d3ab6d19", "link": "/anime/11917/Major__World_Series", "name": "Major: World Series"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/88481.jpg?s=aafdb44d82834819201611cd2aa99eb4", "link": "/anime/36565/Major_2nd_TV", "name": "Major 2nd (TV)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8302\u91ce \u543e\u90ce)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40489v.jpg", "link": "/people/178/Shoutarou_Morikubo", "name": "Morikubo, Shoutarou", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16735v.jpg", "link": "/people/746/Motoko_Kumai", "name": "Kumai, Motoko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15465v.jpg", "link": "/people/14867/Jang_Kim", "name": "Kim, Jang", "language": "Korean"}]}
