He is the older brother to Kari Kamiya (Hikari Yagami in Japan).\n \n As a leader, he almost always acts in a rash and stubborn way without realizing the consequences of his actions (The V-Tamer version is more of a planner). His stubborn and hot-tempered attitude makes him not to listen his comrades for a plan. This has led him to moments of friction and guilt between his friend/rival Matt Ishida (Yamato Ishida in Japan), his oldest friend Sora Takenouchi, as well as his Digimon partner Agumon. However, he manages to do whatever is necessary to rectify the situation, and in times of need, save friends and family from certain doom. He is the bearer of the Crest of Courage.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Taichi Yagami", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/116622.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image":
