{"about": "Age: 15-16\n Blood type: B\n Height: 165cm\n Weight: 55kg\n Birthday: 16 April\n \n Jinta is the main character of the series. In the past, Jinta was an energetic, young boy and the leader of his group, the Super Peace Busters. When Naruko asked him if he had a crush on Menma, he said, \"Why would I be in love with such an ugly&mdash;?\" He had plans to apologize to her the next day, but she died later that night in a drowning accident. \n \n Unable to forgive himself, Jinta spent the next years of his life in a constant state of gloominess. He became withdrawn and eventually became a hikikomori, or a shut-in. He currently lives with his father. While he is enrolled at the same high school as Naruko, he stopped attending. \n \n Jinta now lives a life of exclusion and wears a disguise (consisting of a pair of glasses and a beanie) in order to comfortably leave his house. He has also shown to be socially awkward amongst strangers.\n \n Perhaps Jinta's defining attribute is his ability to see Menma. While no one else can see her, Jinta can communicate with her as well as touch her. Menma says that Jinta needs to fulfill her wish, although neither he nor she can remember what this wish is; however, they do know that it has something to do with their entire childhood group. For Menma's sake, Jinta has been trying to reconnect and reunite with his old friends.\n\n", "name": "Jinta Yadomi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/116629.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/104863.jpg?s=22e0c334a31a4807fa26adc703a854b3", "link": "/manga/35733/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai", "name": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai."}], "member-favorites": 1069, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/79697.jpg?s=e1e5ef1c76eb1583f4c3819f465576cb", "link": "/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai", "name": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai."}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/49993.jpg?s=4845e1e0fc6d3b159bc09873af5f2798", "link": "/anime/15039/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai_Movie", "name": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.
