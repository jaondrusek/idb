{"about": "Age: 18\n Race: Imanity\n \n Stephanie is expressive and emotional to the point where she cannot hide her emotions very well. She loved her grandfather (the former king) dearly and becomes angered when people call him a fool. She loves her kingdom and the world and believes in the potential of Imanity.\n \n She fell in love with Sora due to the pledges forcing her to, and she often has violent outbursts to try to break free of it.\n \n Though, highly educated and intelligent, she isn&#039;t very good at playing games, shown early on when she lost to the two siblings and is forced to obey their whims.\n (Source: Wikipedia, edited)\n\n", "name": "Stephanie Dola", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/274341.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/158035.jpg?s=940f39f7646f12c6272c7f2aa0a1811c", "link": "/manga/48397/No_Game_No_Life", "name": "No Game No Life"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/188186.jpg?s=c0514352ab8b3e401cb724165a1ed7b7", "link": "/manga/48399/No_Game_No_Life", "name": "No Game No Life"}], "member-favorites": 600, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/65187.jpg?s=7ca4071a54d0bbac09c98052bb7fd46f", "link": "/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life", "name": "No Game No Life"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/71783.jpg?s=6b383691d8fbe1101c11ec9e113db1b1", "link": "/anime/24991/No_Game_No_Life_Specials", "name": "No Game No Life Specials"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b9\u30c6\u30d5\u30a1\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30c9\u30fc\u30e9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44597v.jpg", "link": "/people/7263/Yoko_Hikasa", "name": "Hikasa, Yoko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39522v.jpg", "link": "/people/37371/Sara_Ornelas", "name": "Ornelas, Sara", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/39442/Eva_Bau", "name": "Bau, Eva", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/42486v.jpg", "link": "/people/40372/Winnie_Brandes", "name": "Brandes, Winnie", "language": "German"}]}
