{"about": "Age: 15\n \n The girl that brought Mugen and Jin together. Her mother dead, and her father missing for years, we first see her as a teahouse waitress. When the teahouse gets burned down, she takes it as a sign to begin her quest to find the sunflower samurai. \n \n Hidden somewhere in her clothes is Momo-san, her pet flying squirrel, to sometimes help her out of a jam. Fuu is brave, determined, and when she has to improvise (mostly when they're hungry), she uses her wits to reach the goal. \n\n", "name": "Fuu Kasumi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/74061.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/56743.jpg?s=5025bb6cd2a46f9ab4fb7c9b574bd5e4", "link": "/manga/512/Samurai_Champloo", "name": "Samurai Champloo"}], "member-favorites": 724, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/29134.jpg?s=894ef1188c53c7c46df2f99c92645d42", "link": "/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo", "name": "Samurai Champloo"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d5\u30a6)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49118v.jpg", "link": "/people/13/Ayako_Kawasumi", "name": "Kawasumi, Ayako", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39043v.jpg", "link": "/people/350/Kari_Wahlgren", "name": "Wahlgren, Kari", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/21927v.jpg", "link": "/people/1002/Corinna_Dorenkamp", "name": "Dorenkamp, Corinna", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/34439v.jpg", "link": "/people/12507/Iara_Ri\u00e7a", "name": "Ri\u00e7a, Iara", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15219v.jpg", "link": "/people/14583/Alessia_Amendola", "name": "Amendola, Alessia", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15305v.jpg", "link": "/people/14755/Jeong_Hwa_Yang", "name": "Yang, Jeong Hwa", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28727v.jpg", "link": "/people/26569/Chantal_Baroin", "name": "Baroin, Chantal", "language": "French"}]}
