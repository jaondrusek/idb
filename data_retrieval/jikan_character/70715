Anzu doesn&#039;t believe in work. She has no particular interests and would seemingly rather laze about than find something to do. She really only becomes an idol because she believes she will be able to live the rest of her days off her idol earnings. Her laid back attitude and lack of work ethic never changes, even after undergoing idol training.\n \n (Source: Project Imas Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Anzu Futaba", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/340340.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/120159.jpg?s=b45c081f351702e2128f74495561ebc4", "link": "/manga/42333/The_iDOLMSTER_Cinderella_Girls__Shuffle_Comic_Anthology", "name": "The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: Shuffle!!
