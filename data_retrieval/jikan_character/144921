{"about": "One of the Player&#039;s teachers. She teaches Biology. She connects closely with her students, and often consults them about their worries. She may be older, but she has her cute spots, and the students adores her as an older sister. Chitose has loved nature ever since she was small, often riding across fields while admiring the gorgeous sceneries. Because of that, she took biology as her major in college with an emphasis on doing fieldwork. Thanks to that, even now Chitose enjoys taking walks through fields. She loves to move, being the active type. Chitose has domestic chores as a whole nicely tied-down, but she seems especially confident in her cooking. She&#039;s a bit weak in the mornings, and is careful about her bedhair.\n\n", "name": "Chitose Hayase", "image": "", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 0, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/82088.jpg?s=feea9210999eaa1009b3dde258471e43", "link": "/anime/33981/Pretty_x_Cation_2_The_Animation", "name": "Pretty x Cation 2 The Animation"}], "name-japanese": "(\u65e9\u702c \u5343\u6b73)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48268v.jpg", "link": "/people/44939/Aya_Kitamura", "name": "Kitamura, Aya", "language": "Japanese"}]}
