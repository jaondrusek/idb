{"about": "Katejina is a strong-willed seventeen year old girl from Woowing. Separated from her parents around the time of the destruction of her home town by the invading BESPA  forces of the Zanscare Empire, Katejina joins the League Militaire with young Uso Evin. However, Katejina disapproves of the League's reliance on Uso as a gundam pilot due the mounting toll on his young body and mind.\n \n Katejina is captured by Lt. Cronicle Asher and taken to the Zanscare Empire where she becomes Cronicle's personal assistant. Later, she trains as a soldier, eventually becoming a mobile suit ace. It is during this period that her attraction to Cronicle, and hatred of Uso begins to grow. Her personal support for Maria's matriarchal ideals, her annoyance at Uso's continual attempts to interfere with what she views as her true happiness, and her sheer admiration for Cronicle turn her into a dangerous Zanscare loyalist. She and Uso battle on several occasions, where she succeeds in killing several members of the Shrike Team and Odelo Henrik in the process. However, she ultimately loses her memory and what appears to be her eyesight while fighting Uso during the Battle of Angel Halo. After Cronicle is defeated by Uso in the Battle of Angel Halo, Katejina returns to Earth to live out her remaining days in peace.\n\n", "name": "Katejina Loos", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/168943.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 10, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/9993.jpg?s=df03c5fe5bde42b0261ecd04eeff370d", "link": "/anime/89/Mobile_Suit_Victory_Gundam", "name": "Mobile Suit Victory Gundam"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ab\u30c6\u30b8\u30ca\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/16913v.jpg", "link": "/people/248/Kumiko_Watanabe", "name": "Watanabe, Kumiko", "language": "Japanese"}]}
