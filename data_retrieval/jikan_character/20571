{"about": "Sasha is the previous incarnation of Athena who always appears when evil consumes Earth; She spends her childhood with Alone and Tenma in a small village in Italy and is later \"adopted\" by the Sanctuary in Greece. Before leaving for the Sanctuary, she gives Alone and Tenma bracelets made from flowers as a charm that will hopefully reunite them one day. In the Sanctuary, she meets Tenma again as a Saint and later encounters her brother Alone as an enemy. Although being in different positions, Sasha wishes to live with Tenma and Alone again, remembering their promise.\n \n After the death of many of her Saints and her discovery that Alone could bring his Spectres back to life, Sasha raises a barrier with her cosmos covering all the Sanctuary to prevent the Spectres in the area from being revived. However, as long as the barrier remains active, her cosmos will be drained, weakening her. During the invasion of the Sanctuary by Alone and his Spectres, Sasha and the Pope attempted to seal him after seeing Alone trying to kill Tenma, but he manages to escape.\n\n", "name": "Sasha ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/75329.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/163126.jpg?s=c60e699264cceec96b6cb2094d483b43", "link": "/manga/1047/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/129599.jpg?s=da99e2fcd406ee6d2577893e983580b4", "link": "/manga/25916/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa_Gaiden", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa Gaiden"}], "member-favorites": 64, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/75546.jpg?s=a532cddc9e84b080f4e0aecbde9330ab", "link": "/anime/6171/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/29597.jpg?s=9a6b38060967686f8277fd764633375a", "link": "/anime/9130/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa_2", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa 2"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5973\u795e / \u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/47927v.jpg", "link": "/people/4/Aya_Hirano", "name": "Hirano, Aya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/4272v.jpg", "link": "/people/7326/Nuria_Trifol", "name": "Trifol, Nuria", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/38830v.jpg", "link": "/people/11520/Luciana_Baroli", "name": "Baroli, Luciana", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32749v.jpg", "link": "/people/31523/Leyla_Rangel", "name": "Rangel, Leyla", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/37615v.jpg", "link": "/people/35767/Martina_Felli", "name": "Felli, Martina", "language": "Italian"}]}
