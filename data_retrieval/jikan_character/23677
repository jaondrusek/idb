{"about": "Affiliation: Golden Lion Pirates\n Devil Fruit: Fuwa Fuwa no Mi\n Birthday: July 6th\n \n Shiki the Golden Lion (\u91d1\u7345\u5b50\u306e\u30b7\u30ad, Kinjishi no Shiki?), is a notorious pirate who is known to be the first prisoner to have ever escaped Impel Down. He was a pirate that wreaked havoc during Roger&#039;s time and is the main antagonist of the 10th One Piece Movie. His nickname, Kinjishi, means \"golden lion.\"\n \n Shiki is a pirate dressed in yellow traditional Japanese clothes. He has golden mane-like hair and on the top of his head is a part of steering wheel that got lodged into his head after his battle with Roger. Due to him cutting off his shackled legs to escape Impel Down, he has swords for prosthetic legs for which he can easily stand upon without much trouble. His overall design resembles a typical shogun.\n \n (Source: One Piece Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Shiki ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/68595.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/55539.jpg?s=7aca9e1277114171668059d01700c1f9", "link": "/manga/13/One_Piece", "name": "One Piece"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/25743.jpg?s=eb4dbda3677e2923edea654a67488bab", "link": "/manga/17152/One_Piece__Strong_World", "name": "One Piece: Strong World"}], "member-favorites": 2, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/73245.jpg?s=fefb87c23843d98b1763024553ae0d46", "link": "/anime/21/One_Piece", "name": "One Piece"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/75894.jpg?s=7b53de8af947e268d601c1a011095e81", "link": "/anime/4155/One_Piece_Film__Strong_World", "name": "One Piece Film: Strong World"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/24152.jpg?s=b2d5c3417eef9d3701d3cd97ec82ad53", "link": "/anime/8740/One_Piece_Film__Strong_World_Episode_0", "name": "One Piece Film: Strong World Episode 0"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b7\u30ad)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/26369v.jpg", "link": "/people/551/Scott_McNeil", "name": "McNeil, Scott", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/5928v.jpg", "link": "/people/8631/Naoto_Takenaka", "name": "Takenaka, Naoto", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15347v.jpg", "link": "/people/14779/Gi_hyeon_Kim", "name": "Kim, Gi hyeon", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/26415v.jpg", "link": "/people/23637/Ekkehardt_Belle", "name": "Belle, Ekkehardt", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/30489v.jpg", "link": "/people/29163/Philippe_Valmont", "name": "Valmont, Philippe", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/46855v.jpg", "link": "/people/43428/Sergio_Roman\u00f2", "name": "Roman\u00f2, Sergio", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/50123v.jpg", "link": "/people/45979/Rafael_Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez_Arrieta", "name": "Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Arrieta, Rafael", "language": "Spanish"}]}
