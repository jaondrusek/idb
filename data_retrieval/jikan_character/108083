{"about": "A detective in the metropolitan police department. He used to work in the investigations division but now works in the records division. He's a contemporary of the head of the terror incident investigation. He is aloof and lazy, with a reluctance to work, but when push comes to shove and people's lives are in danger he quickly turns into a smart, quick-minded man being able to solve most problems that arise. He is extremely experienced in his field and has a strong sense of justice.\n \n (Source: Zankyou no Terror Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Kenjirou Shibazaki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/254787.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 265, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/64447.jpg?s=ed0a5017a0268973ca43c1e52832ad03", "link": "/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror", "name": "Zankyou no Terror"}], "name-japanese": "(\u67f4\u5d0e \u5065\u6b21\u90ce)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/43298v.jpg", "link": "/people/666/Robert_McCollum", "name": "McCollum, Robert", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/43188v.jpg", "link": "/people/7492/Shunsuke_Sakuya", "name": "Sakuya, Shunsuke", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/22061v.jpg", "link": "/people/9256/Philippe_Roullier", "name": "Roullier, Philippe", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/43364v.jpg", "link": "/people/11911/Thomas_Schmuckert", "name": "Schmuckert, Thomas", "language": "German"}]}
