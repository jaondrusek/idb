{"about": "Birthday: June 5\n \n Mami is a veteran magical girl and a third-year student at Madoka&#039;s school. She lives alone in a penthouse after the death of her parents in a car accident, one which she was able to survive only due to contracting with Kyubey to save her own life. \n \n Mami is particularly focused on saving those around her, with a traditionally selfless perspective on the role of magical girl, and has a habit of giving names to her finishing attacks. Though her outward disposition is cheery and confident, Mami feels deeply alone as she has no friends to confide in or support her as she fights. \n \n Madoka offers to become her partner and save her from her loneliness, but Mami is killed immediately after during battle with a witch; as per Madoka&#039;s wish, at the close of the final timeline, this witch never existed, and Mami is therefore seen, alive, with Kyoko and Homura at the end of the series. According to Kyubey, she never knew the darker truths concerning Soul Gems and origins of witches. In a previous timeline, learning of these truths drove Mami insane and she attempted to murder the remaining magical girls to prevent them from becoming witches, and in the Oriko Magica timeline, she contemplates letting herself be killed and/or committing suicide so she doesn&#039;t become a witch herself.\n\n", "name": "Mami Tomoe", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/141631.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/41783.jpg?s=539f64e23165eafaeb885d002171ddcf", "link": "/manga/24295/Mahou_Shoujo_Kazumi\u2605Magica__The_Innocent_Malice", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Kazumi\u2605Magica: The Innocent Malice"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/99257.jpg?s=a239e01fa7e8270404f2efda5f0b005e", "link": "/manga/24456/Mahou_Shoujo_Oriko\u2605Magica", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Oriko\u2605Magica"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/149732.jpg?s=c5ac01df756983afa16a6e032106a039", "link": "/manga/24457/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/110093.jpg?s=695ea787d0231e64537f9883157caa5a", "link": "/manga/28961/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica__Anthology_Comic", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica: Anthology Comic"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/53479.jpg?s=5b9b3ad374d5259e865f567b4dc40f9b", "link": "/manga/30257/RKGKMDK", "name": "RKGKMDK"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/78173.jpg?s=df50e6c0985ec1a4bf405f6260ac20b4", "link": "/manga/44319/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica__The_Different_Story", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica: The Different Story"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/107535.jpg?s=b14c01aeaf7ab6bd09e2626d1994ee3b", "link": "/manga/62671/Gekijouban_Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica__Shinpen_-_Hangyaku_no_Monogatari", "name": "Gekijouban Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica: Shinpen -
