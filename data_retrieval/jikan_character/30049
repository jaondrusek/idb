{"about": "Birthday: March 27\n \n Ritsu is a 25-year-old jaded literary editor. He is the only son of the head of Onodera Publication and previously worked at his father&#039;s company in the literature department. Hearing his fellow co-workers accusing him of taking hand-outs from his father, he decides to show that he can be successful on his own by going to work at Marukawa Publishing. After being hurt by his first love in high school when he was 15, Ritsu vowed to never fall in love again. His resolve is tested, however; when he is reunited with the boy he once loved: now very much a man and his new boss! It was also mentioned that he was one of Usami Akihiko&#039;s (from Junjou Romantica) editors at his previous job.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Ritsu Onodera", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/119012.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/14369.jpg?s=e251f4583ed9927114090babbfcca515", "link": "/manga/10573/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Onodera_Ritsu_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Onodera Ritsu no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/44313.jpg?s=e47b99a4ad9f5ee49d20b983dfa22ece", "link": "/manga/26224/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yoshino_Chiaki_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yoshino Chiaki no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/81400.jpg?s=49f8ab1e46a83b091cc97d7b1632eef2", "link": "/manga/31105/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}], "member-favorites": 759, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/35863.jpg?s=79e32a75581f0b42777ff50ec311cec2", "link": "/anime/8063/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_OVA", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi OVA"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/29763.jpg?s=62c940272d145be1beb8cc2e524c1fc8", "link": "/anime/9926/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/34871.jpg?s=4446ddce68f9b3002d41525c5482aaa1", "link": "/anime/11123/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_2", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/65927.jpg?s=9e47a5b2c7f469e9990a4ca5f202ae8a", "link": "/anime/20371/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_Movie__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi Movie: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/55723.jpg?s=caa44a790ff16b409b6f3b008d957782", "link": "/anime/20815/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Valentine-hen", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Valentine-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5c0f\u91ce\u5bfa\u5f8b)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48577v.jpg", "link": "/people/206/Takashi_Kondou", "name": "Kondou, Takashi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
