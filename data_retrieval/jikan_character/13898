{"about": "Bisuke is a 57-year-old woman who looks like a 12-year-old girl, and is a master and experienced teacher of Nen. She continues the Nen training Wing gave to Gon and Killua during the Celestial Tower arc.\n \n As a Treasure Hunter, Biscuit loves collecting rare jewels (and gets very excited about them; she has a habit of naming them) and getting money.\n \n Biscuit has a devious personality. She initially uses her cutesy appearance and demeanor to her advantage whether it&#039;s for information gathering, getting what she wants, or even in combat by acting innocent and helpless so most people will usually put their guards down around her. However, as a teacher of Nen, she has a stern and serious attitude towards her students.\n \n Though in the beginning she was out to destroy Gon and Killua&#039;s friendship, at the end of Greed Island she acknowledges (albeit, in her head) that she&#039;s close to developing parental feelings toward the two of them.\n (Source: Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Biscuit Krueger", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/194667.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/192445.jpg?s=ffa1972e309c94080906480eb6a19114", "link": "/manga/26/Hunter_x_Hunter", "name": "Hunter x Hunter"}], "member-favorites": 265, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/37203.jpg?s=36abd02a3df05eb91e674c6e70bcbcf3", "link": "/anime/138/Hunter_x_Hunter__Greed_Island", "name": "Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/139.jpg?s=cde94b44661e4d2e5b7327eb1af3aac1", "link": "/anime/139/Hunter_x_Hunter__Greed_Island_Final", "name": "Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island Final"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/33657.jpg?s=0072a7f102c58d61f1043b7e2fdca722", "link": "/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011", "name": "Hunter x Hunter (2011)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/62337.jpg?s=bfc0cb4f2d0b7f8a1d26a3dd391edc22", "link": "/anime/19951/Hunter_x_Hunter_Movie__The_Last_Mission", "name": "Hunter x Hunter Movie: The Last Mission"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\uff1d\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/45444v.jpg", "link": "/people/467/Akiko_Kimura", "name": "Kimura, Akiko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/9710v.jpg", "link": "/people/904/Chisa_Yokoyama", "name": "Yokoyama, Chisa", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/35719v.jpg", "link": "/people/1082/Tara_Sands", "name": "Sands, Tara", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/8966v.jpg", "link": "/people/10497/Takashi_Hagino", "name": "Hagino, Takashi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/34149v.jpg", "link": "/people/11403/Flora_Paulita", "name": "Paulita, Flora", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/24921v.jpg", "link": "/people/21811/Alessandra_Karpoff", "name": "Karpoff, Alessandra", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/47617v.jpg", "link": "/people/44177/Bettina_Kenney", "name": "Kenney, Bettina", "language": "German"}]}
