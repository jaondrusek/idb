Her name is based on the slave girl who served Alibaba in \"Alibaba and the forty thieves\".\n \n Morgiana was Jamil&rsquo;s slave before. She was emotionless and unfriendly at first, but as time passed after she was liberated, she became more emotional little by little.\n \n Although she looks like a normal girl, she can get closer with an enemy far away in an instant. In addition to her strong leg strength which can even enable her to vertically run up walls, she has a keen sense of smell on par with that of a dog&rsquo;s, can also smell the stench of death emanating from the bottom of the pit and the smell of someone hiding in unseen places. Although weaker than her leg strength, her arm strength is strong enough to send a human like Alibaba flying.\n \n After Alibaba&rsquo;s departure from Qishan, she put the words of her defector, Goltas, on her chest, and started a journey to her hometown, Katarg. In the middle of her journey towards Balbadd, she helped Leila and Sahsa&rsquo;s caravan to eliminate the thieves at the rock quarry. She reunites with Aladdin after that, and then joins Alibaba again in Balbadd.\n \n She views Alibaba as her savior for freeing her and the other slaves from slavery with the wealth his obtained from Amon&#039;s dungeon and greatly values her relationship with both Alibaba and Aladdin, saying they are the most important people to her.\n \n She later becomes a Household Member under Alibaba&#039;s Amon which grants her power through her Household Vessel. Her Household Vessel took forms in her Slave shackles since its something she had many feelings for as she wore them for many years, Alibaba later gives her a necklace as a parting gift before he goes to train in Laem, this becomes her second Household Vessel so she can further use Alibabas power even when they are apart.\n \n She is proposed to by Hakuryuu but rejects him.\n The name Morgiana (\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0629) means coral in Arabic.\n \n In chapter 314, she accepts Alibaba&#039;s marriage proposal.\n\n", "name": "Morgiana ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/173513.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/201605.jpg?s=eb6b54b8cb4f7dbb17f00224474a79ac", "link": "/manga/14790/Magi", "name": "Magi"}], "member-favorites": 3561, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/42773.jpg?s=1b50af0eaa65cb56298ee2328dca454f", "link": "/anime/14513/Magi__The_Labyrinth_of_Magic", "name": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/55039.jpg?s=ad0881dd9f168ef827dd2b30ba682ec9", "link": "/anime/18115/Magi__The_Kingdom_of_Magic", "name": "Magi: The Kingdom of Magic"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e2\u30eb\u30b8\u30a2\u30ca)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44707v.jpg", "link": "/people/489/Cristina_Valenzuela", "name": "Valenzuela, Cristina", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44285v.jpg", "link": "/people/890/Haruka_Tomatsu", "name": "Tomatsu, Haruka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/21927v.jpg", "link": "/people/1002/Corinna_Dorenkamp", "name": "Dorenkamp, Corinna", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32319v.jpg", "link": "/people/7302/Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique_Marlot", "name": "Marlot, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15407v.jpg", "link": "/people/14835/Hyeon_Jin_Lee", "name": "Lee, Hyeon Jin", "language": "Korean"}]}
