{"about": "A young high school student, who is timid but good-natured. He was accidentally pulled into Selesia&#039;s anime in the beginning of the story and unintentionally brought her with him back to the real world. He aspires to make his own light novel, that is similar to Selesia&#039;s. However, he currently seems to suffer from artist&#039;s block. He eventually uncovers Military Uniform Princess&#039; true identity, but reluctantly chose to withhold this information from the others.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Souta Mizushino", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/322617.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/199589.jpg?s=e0e32ca02ec678efcf850b21e3620831", "link": "/manga/103727/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "member-favorites": 32, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/85469.jpg?s=5e186ab3cfff5f4da1c3c4dce4c74395", "link": "/anime/34561/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6c34\u7be0 \u98af\u592a)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42618v.jpg", "link": "/people/21971/Daiki_Yamashita", "name": "Yamashita, Daiki", "language": "Japanese"}]}
