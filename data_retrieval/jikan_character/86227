{"about": "Birthday: July 3\n \n A mature and independent girl from the Land of Sea and one of the students from Shioshishio. She is very calm and doesn&#039;t seem to like fighting or bullying. She is also a childhood friend of Hikari, Manaka, and Kaname.\n \n She has feelings for Hikari but is afraid to admit it after realizing he is in love with Manaka. She is afraid it will ruin their relationships and hides her feelings. Chisaki is the only person among her Shioshishio friends who avoided hibernation after the Ofunehiki festival. Since the Ofunehiki festival, she has been staying with the Kihara family and also further studied in a nursing school. When she reunites with her Shioshishio friends, she feels left out as she is now much older than the rest. Chisaki fears change, and feels guilty for having lived a relatively happy life during the time-skip despite the absence of her friends. She has been clinging to her old feelings for Hikari as a means of claiming she hasn&#039;t changed over the past five years, but in reality she is in love with Tsumugu.\n Later in the series, Tsumugu and Chisaki get together.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Chisaki Hiradaira", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/224287.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/103479.jpg?s=0845066097e063539df8bfadd1dc41cd", "link": "/manga/55063/Nagi_no_Asu_kara", "name": "Nagi no Asu kara"}], "member-favorites": 894, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/53549.jpg?s=e10f1c8296dd5bc79f1b4152d7f74c5c", "link": "/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara", "name": "Nagi no Asukara"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6bd4\u826f\u5e73 \u3061\u3055\u304d)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46122v.jpg", "link": "/people/10765/Ai_Kayano", "name": "Kayano, Ai", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39681v.jpg", "link": "/people/37519/Brianna_Knickerbocker", "name": "Knickerbocker, Brianna", "language": "English"}]}
