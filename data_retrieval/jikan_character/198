{"about": "Age: 16\n Birthday: November 30\n Blood type: B\n High: 154 cm\n Weight: 43 kg\n \n Tenma Tsukamoto is the female protagonist who loves Ouji Karasuma. Tenma is short, undeveloped and childish for her age. She often is mistaken as being younger than her classmates and her younger sister Yakumo. One of her obvious physical features are the little ponytails in her hair, which often wiggle if she is happy or excited. She is also dense, slow and unreliable and often misunderstands otherwise obvious situations. Despite her shortcomings, Tenma is good-natured and friendly.\n\n", "name": "Tenma Tsukamoto", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/30856.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5267.jpg?s=b6db00c6eaf26739a5ba7f221c8d461b", "link": "/manga/160/School_Rumble", "name": "School Rumble"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/22036.jpg?s=47094f360a67f6725a88eb571d3703a5", "link": "/manga/9259/School_Rumble_Z", "name": "School Rumble Z"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/29068.jpg?s=e6f7196d3d91f8b4bc37ad08b2f7c638", "link": "/manga/18982/Bessatsu_School_Rumble", "name": "Bessatsu School Rumble"}], "member-favorites": 574, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/75488.jpg?s=6a1a9ddcb77f542e5d49c67a27848887", "link": "/anime/24/School_Rumble", "name": "School Rumble"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75489.jpg?s=e9db10e10b6fc2e1211aa7d114e1787a", "link": "/anime/517/School_Rumble_Ichi_Gakki_Hoshuu", "name": "School Rumble Ichi Gakki Hoshuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75490.jpg?s=393b8918e48d90d7f37e2523b0820b41", "link": "/anime/846/School_Rumble_Ni_Gakki", "name": "School Rumble Ni Gakki"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/9553.jpg?s=d3e7b6b9780d5e794bd5400b761c9fac", "link": "/anime/4015/School_Rumble_San_Gakki", "name": "School Rumble San Gakki"}], "name-japanese": "(\u585a\u672c \u5929\u6e80)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/30111v.jpg", "link": "/people/70/Ami_Koshimizu", "name": "Koshimizu, Ami", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49236v.jpg", "link": "/people/189/Luci_Christian", "name": "Christian, Luci", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/22467v.jpg", "link": "/people/1162/Benedetta_Ponticelli", "name": "Ponticelli, Benedetta", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40359v.jpg", "link": "/people/5123/Kristina_von_Weltzien", "name": "von Weltzien, Kristina", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/22469v.jpg", "link": "/people/5681/Isabelle_Volpe", "name": "Volpe, Isabelle", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15319v.jpg", "link": "/people/14771/Seon_hui_Mun", "name": "Mun, Seon hui", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49707v.jpg", "link": "/people/20494/Carmen_Ambr\u00f3s", "name": "Ambr\u00f3s, Carmen", "language": "Spanish"}]}
