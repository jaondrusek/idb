{"about": "Team: Karasuno High, Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High (former)\n Age: 15\n Height: 180.6 cm\n Weight: 66.3 kg\n Birthday: December 22\n Year: 1st Year, class 3\n Number: 9\n Position: Setter\n Favorite Food: Pork curry with a soft-boiled egg on top\n Current Concerns: He&#039;s worried that animals seem to dislike him\n Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 4; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 4\n \n Kageyama was initially referred to as \"King of the Court,\" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture&#039;s players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team.\n \n Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration and express his thoughts and emotions in an appropriate way.\n \n Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. This has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter.\n \n (Source: Haikyuu!!
