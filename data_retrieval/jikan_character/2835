{"about": "One of the most notorious delinquents of Cromartie. Though he is a robot, no one but the main characters seems to notice, including himself. Other delinquents rely on him and he gives good advice. \n \n Mechazawa is bad with machines:\n \"Why are you bringing ME your electronics? I want to help you guys in any way I can -- even if I gotta put my life on the line! But when it comes to MACHINES, I'm helpless myself.\"\n \n From the character profile:\n People seem to find this robot deliquent a bit unbelievable; however, both male and female readers are enamored of Mechazawa for his cerebral and down-to-earth remarks. But whatever way you look at it, Mechazawa is a robot - though he obnoxiously tries to play himself of as a human.\n\n", "name": "Shinichi Mechazawa", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/77978.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157310.jpg?s=ec59c95a517d0f6b938ac8ae3f65de5d", "link": "/manga/339/Sakigake_Cromartie_Koukou", "name": "Sakigake!!
