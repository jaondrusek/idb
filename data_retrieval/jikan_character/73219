{"about": "Birthday: August 16\n Height: 157 cm\n Weight: 43 kg\n Chest: 73 cm\n Blood Type: AB\n Specialty: Super High-school Level Gangster\n VA: Daisuke Kishio\n \n Kuzuryuu is initially incredibly stand-offish and rude to the other students on the island. He claims he&#039;s not going to play at being friends with anyone, and when questioned on this in Chapter 1, states clearly that he would not hesitate to kill any one of them. He makes frequent reference to his yakuza background, and seems adamant at presenting this sort of \"lone wolf\" attitude. He does not simply not want to make friends, but considers it not worth his time and beneath him.\n \n When he does interract with the others (by choice or otherwise) his attitude is combative and irritable. He&#039;s easily angered, often threatening and/or insulting other people when they disagree with or complain about his actions.\n \n He  is particularly sensitive about his appearance, and it is suggested that it would not be out of the question for him to react violently if someone were to use the word \"babyface\" in reference to him. This is likely due to his status as the heir to the largest yakuza syndicate in the country. People would expect a big tough guy to lead a yakuza family, but Kuzuryuu&#039;s appearance is the opposite of that. Kuzuryuu states that he wants to be strong on his own, and not to simply rely on his family&#039;s power to get ahead in life. His goal is to be strong enough to lead his family, rather than to be strong because he leads his family.\n \n Kuzuryuu is one of the few people who survive at the end.\n\n", "name": "Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/323915.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/123439.jpg?s=22ddbc8a3a4792ce8192d2abc3471383", "link": "/manga/44229/Super_Danganronpa_2__Nanami_Chiaki_no_Sayonara_Zetsubou_Daibouken", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Nanami Chiaki no Sayonara Zetsubou Daibouken"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/78039.jpg?s=73a8770a8987cb0c0dff0aef2980f384", "link": "/manga/44243/Super_Danganronpa_2__Sayonara_Zetsubou_Gakuen_-_4-koma_KINGS", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Sayonara Zetsubou Gakuen - 4-koma KINGS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/184555.jpg?s=e1ffb2f47acd675c4b59f5c8adb6112c", "link": "/manga/48441/Super_Danganronpa_2__Chou_Koukou-kyuu_no_Kouun_to_Kibou_to_Zetsubou", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Chou Koukou-kyuu no Kouun to Kibou to Zetsubou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/179039.jpg?s=5d6248ee157522ba2770aafc7de10491", "link": "/manga/51575/Super_Danganronpa_2__Dangan_Island_Kokoro_Tokonatsu_Kokoronpa\u266a", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Dangan Island Kokoro Tokonatsu, Kokoronpa\u266a"}], "member-favorites": 210, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/80931.jpg?s=40886f3f5ef9ce1e20e95792a5b68224", "link": "/anime/32189/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Mirai-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80932.jpg?s=ef1bd8513699f5ef043857050438eb59", "link": "/anime/33028/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Zetsubou-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Zetsubou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/82068.jpg?s=767d8bd5e166716dac2e126fa0bec2a0", "link": "/anime/34103/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Kibou-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Kibou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/83150.jpg?s=a50577a33718a07d15de2f293c8b7969", "link": "/anime/34152/Super_Danganronpa_25__Komaeda_Nagito_to_Sekai_no_Hakaimono", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2.5: Komaeda Nagito to Sekai no Hakaimono"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/47511v.jpg", "link": "/people/254/Aaron_Dismuke", "name": "Dismuke, Aaron", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/29725v.jpg", "link": "/people/440/Daisuke_Kishio", "name": "Kishio, Daisuke", "language": "Japanese"}]}
