During his lifetime, Kiritsugu was disillusioned with becoming a Hero of Justice, a defender of humanity who could save everyone. Although he feels he failed to do so, his efforts were a source of inspiration for Shirou.\n \n Prior to his fateful meeting with Shirou, Kiritsugu was notorious as the \"Magus Killer,\" a freelancer who would hunt down heretical magi. Although he was a magus with Magic Circuits and abilities he was considered unorthodox in that he would utilize modern technology and weaponry along with his magecraft to track down and kill magi.\n \n Although mentioned and seen in flashbacks in Fate/stay night, Kiritsugu is one of the main protagonists in its prequel Fate/Zero.\n \n Due to his father, Norikata Emiya, fourth family head of the Emiya family and a magus who received a Sealing Designation, Kiritsugu lost his mother shortly after he was born. Father and son were on the run from the Mage&#039;s Association, and thus Kiritsugu spent his youth wandering around the world with his father.\n\n", "name": "Kiritsugu Emiya", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/302007.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/115669.jpg?s=c0709c012ccb5f3cf05fe2ed8682d7eb", "link": "/manga/715/Fate_stay_night", "name": "Fate/stay night"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/151202.jpg?s=f63c38ec53118986b9a51d473beaafae", "link": "/manga/3526/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma\u2606Illya", "name": "Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/186073.jpg?s=a41062590441db9e70d81fc5fcff17c2", "link": "/manga/3649/Fate_Zero", "name": "Fate/Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/59085.jpg?s=315bfb2f703d843b2e2db3d236669683", "link": "/manga/13856/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma\u2606Illya_2wei", "name": "Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya 2wei!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/196931.jpg?s=40f1f42a4a221f2cb90477fcefac17d4", "link": "/manga/25191/Fate_Zero", "name": "Fate/Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/44057.jpg?s=7b5344e7b7aa46f59d2518f5f8d6bc57", "link": "/manga/27327/All_Around_Type-Moon", "name": "All Around Type-Moon"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/80841.jpg?s=8e00657af74cf34d0e2713fafdcabdb3", "link": "/manga/36131/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma\u2606Illya_3rei", "name": "Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya 3rei!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/162251.jpg?s=88f09e2dfd3090065b3a6e23af020381", "link": "/manga/36803/Heart_of_Freaks", "name": "Heart of Freaks"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/155052.jpg?s=50f23fb3c9b3dc3cafd9012694a292dc", "link": "/manga/87581/Type-Moon_Gakuen__Chibichuki", "name": "Type-Moon Gakuen: Chibichuki!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/159383.jpg?s=97c3929baaddf314b2ec39dd34dcdac7", "link": "/manga/88110/Fate_stay_night__Heavens_Feel", "name": "Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel"}], "member-favorites": 8136, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/30327.jpg?s=5f5b667dc9a03c2ca2d0a980a3afe894", "link": "/anime/356/Fate_stay_night", "name": "Fate/stay night"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/73249.jpg?s=58bcdcbc5b4333748388c87f718ad31d", "link": "/anime/10087/Fate_Zero", "name": "Fate/Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/41125.jpg?s=4b40de715651ccd15390d875013bcd1b", "link": "/anime/11741/Fate_Zero_2nd_Season", "name": "Fate/Zero 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/37081.jpg?s=fdd9a05baf40aae42572a32c459a143f", "link": "/anime/13183/Fate_Zero_Remix", "name": "Fate/Zero Remix"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/64175.jpg?s=b66c0ce1b7a5958ab6cfc10690e43e8c", "link": "/anime/20509/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma\u2606Illya_2wei", "name": "Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya 2wei!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/67333.jpg?s=4912d31c1e88f70c2bda8b1074eb6985", "link": "/anime/22297/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works", "name": "Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/87106.jpg?s=a8e16f13be4c1fa6f901eb79eaa177d7", "link": "/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_-_I_Presage_Flower", "name": "Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - I.
