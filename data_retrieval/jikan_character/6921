{"about": "Yoshihiko is extremely talented in sports (especially baseball), but he has no interest in it whatsoever (similar to Initial D's Takumi Fujiwara). He also seems to have no interest in girls... until the day he met Aya Kurihara. However, after her return to France, he met his girlfriend Natsue Horikawa during baseball practice. He also had a run-in with the young idol Jyunna Morio when she escaped and got lost from her studio taping.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia, edited)\n\n", "name": "Yoshihiko Kenjo", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/44810.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/183366.jpg?s=4356026f7ce75b915c1d29f2cfccd957", "link": "/manga/152/Boys_Be", "name": "Boys Be..."}], "member-favorites": 0, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/2223.jpg?s=40d1cc7ce0f79d1f3b78a33ad794e732", "link": "/anime/105/Boys_Be", "name": "Boys Be..."}], "name-japanese": "(\u5263\u57ce\u7f8e\u5f66)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37829v.jpg", "link": "/people/340/Patrick_Seitz", "name": "Seitz, Patrick", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/17817v.jpg", "link": "/people/412/Hideo_Ishikawa", "name": "Ishikawa, Hideo", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/4734v.jpg", "link": "/people/7603/Alessandro_Quarta", "name": "Quarta, Alessandro", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/22429v.jpg", "link": "/people/20080/Christophe_Hespel", "name": "Hespel, Christophe", "language": "French"}]}
