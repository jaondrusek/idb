{"about": "The mysterious leader of the Neo-Zeon remnant forces who is described as the \"Second Coming of Char Aznable\", the legendary Red Comet. Like Char, he is a tall blond man who hides his face behind a half-mask, wears a red uniform and pilots a red mobile suit. His face, voice and tone closely resemble those of Char as well.\n \n Similar to Char, Full Frontal holds the Neo-Zeon remants together through sheer charisma. Whether the name is an alias is unspecified. His name holds a double-meaning, referring both to being stark naked and the combat tactic of full frontal assault.\n \n He leads around Banagher and the others with his puzzling speech and behavior. He fights against the Earth Federation for the secret lying at the center of the foundation of the Universal Century.\n\n", "name": "Full Frontal", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/72017.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/179084.jpg?s=01af214eb6d0983d2f107ee9090e9c0e", "link": "/manga/5177/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_Unicorn", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam Unicorn"}], "member-favorites": 76, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/50459.jpg?s=5df11f1dfc4f792c7368de77b2fe60d8", "link": "/anime/6336/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Unicorn", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/78633.jpg?s=f1183bd3aa28b2950ac94ad9beec0f7d", "link": "/anime/32792/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Unicorn_RE_0096", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:0096"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d5\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/34777v.jpg", "link": "/people/598/Shuuichi_Ikeda", "name": "Ikeda, Shuuichi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/33313v.jpg", "link": "/people/5476/Keith_Silverstein", "name": "Silverstein, Keith", "language": "English"}]}
