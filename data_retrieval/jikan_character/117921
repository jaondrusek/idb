{"about": "Birthday: June 10\n Height: 220 cm (7&#039;2\")\n Affiliation: Yuuei\n Quirk: One for All\n \n All Might is the No. 1 Hero and the \"Symbol of Peace.\" He is famous for routinely saving the day with a smile on his face.\n \n In his hero form, All Might is a very tall and muscular man whose design resembles classic American superhero comics. His whole body has more shadows than a normal human being.\n \n However, in his true form, he appears to be grossly underweight. During an encounter with a villain five years ago, he suffered life threatening injuries; the medical procedures that saved his life left him with an extremely frail physique. Now he can only serve as a hero for three hours a day, as his body cannot handle any more exertion.\n (Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wikia, edited)\n\n", "name": "All Might ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/310613.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/141381.jpg?s=ed8c465f458a0453a27e90b2de83a79c", "link": "/manga/75989/Boku_no_Hero_Academia", "name": "Boku no Hero Academia"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/195519.jpg?s=a716f2d4de56ceb2c9631ef7eac6c36c", "link": "/manga/99949/Vigilante__Boku_no_Hero_Academia_Illegals", "name": "Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals"}], "member-favorites": 2388, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/78745.jpg?s=59f9035649b6193750fef07f04835326", "link": "/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia", "name": "Boku no Hero Academia"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/85221.jpg?s=6e0b85f7968f58a5b300720c2797e89e", "link": "/anime/33486/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_2nd_Season", "name": "Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/83988.jpg?s=d5acc3633af0cbcf41a207837d5e44af", "link": "/anime/33929/Boku_no_Hero_Academia__Sukue_Kyuujo_Kunren", "name": "Boku no Hero Academia: Sukue!
