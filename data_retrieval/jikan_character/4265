He was born September 9 and is nicknamed Toshi.\n \n Toshiya is a character that is featured as Goro&#039;s friend and rival through the series through he grows from a five-year-old shy kid into a professional baseball player. He is a serious and intelligent character with a great love for baseball. His position is catcher. When he is abandoned by his parents at the age of 11 and taken in by his grandparents, becoming a professional baseball player becomes his goal, something he starts to chase after ruthlessly. Toshiya has a warm character and he values his friends dearly, he has a high but realistic opinion of Goro. On the field however he has a cold and manipulative personality which puts off his opponents and makes him a very difficult person to play against but as a teammate he is more then reliable. His weak point is his tendency to think too much which causes him to get bouts of depression at times. A tendency that puts him opposite of Goro which is one of the things that makes them such a good battery, when they form one. During the series, Sato Toshiya and Honda Goro are more often opponents than teammates. \n \n (Source: Major Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Toshiya Satou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/83487.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/185602.jpg?s=9e663c97e1d2f4d20044bc27cb139c4a", "link": "/manga/10978/Major", "name": "Major"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/157412.jpg?s=cd734d10b12b6ee59b643fbf2f89d9a3", "link": "/manga/87201/Major_2nd", "name": "Major 2nd"}], "member-favorites": 73, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/73972.jpg?s=247e4b5cfb4f609df47299d1f96608c0", "link": "/anime/558/Major_S2", "name": "Major S2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/73973.jpg?s=ef5a8d924c7238c2ce4d9c95e48d0a07", "link": "/anime/627/Major_S1", "name": "Major S1"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/73971.jpg?s=d5406e5c31c1e6b475f327da2f3d26fe", "link": "/anime/1842/Major_S3", "name": "Major S3"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75217.jpg?s=eab87db913224b7f4b5e286c8cb8d518", "link": "/anime/3226/Major_S4", "name": "Major S4"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75218.jpg?s=e7b24adc99184dab6cd8a046cab5548e", "link": "/anime/5028/Major_S5", "name": "Major S5"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/75221.jpg?s=83a87d06d683f9a8a2af11fb99e481cb", "link": "/anime/5029/Major_Movie__Yuujou_no_Winning_Shot", "name": "Major Movie: Yuujou no Winning Shot"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/75216.jpg?s=b3c0f32367436d42d25165c399c01480", "link": "/anime/7655/Major_S6", "name": "Major S6"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/75219.jpg?s=d1fa5704c98223943876d9af497dc55a", "link": "/anime/9890/Major__Message", "name": "Major: Message"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75220.jpg?s=899b158057701b3befc1c313d3ab6d19", "link": "/anime/11917/Major__World_Series", "name": "Major: World Series"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4f50\u85e4 \u5bff\u4e5f)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/10301v.jpg", "link": "/people/205/Masakazu_Morita", "name": "Morita, Masakazu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/10723v.jpg", "link": "/people/935/Fuyuka_Ono", "name": "Ono, Fuyuka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15445v.jpg", "link": "/people/14853/Yong_Wu_Shin", "name": "Shin, Yong Wu", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15829v.jpg", "link": "/people/14995/Hye_Ok_Jeong", "name": "Jeong, Hye Ok", "language": "Korean"}]}
