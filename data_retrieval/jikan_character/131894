{"about": "Mikazuki is a calm and collected individual with a head for the big picture. He has an easygoing personality and is devoted to his comrades. He is cold-blooded to his enemies, fighting them, particularly Gjallarhorn, without any sense of honor. He is deeply loyal to his friend Orga Itsuka and steadfastly follows any order or request without question.\n \n On the other hand, due to his background as a child soldier, he has difficulty interacting with people outside of Tekkadan and has a limited understanding of girls and relationships. Also, he seems to favor violence whenever he comes across someone or something he perceives as a threat, regardless if said violence is actually called for. \n \n Mikazuki is the most experienced and the most capable mobile worker operator in CGS, thus he was assigned to pilot the Gundam Barbatos. He has received the Alaya-Vijnana System surgical treatment three times and survived. In mobile suit combat, Mikazuki prefers to fight in close range and is often seen using mace-type weapons. Although he has also used swords, guns, and cannons when required. Mikazuki can be reckless at times and has no qualms wrecking his Barbatos during battle. His excellent mobile suit piloting skills eventually earned him the nickname \"Devil\".\n \n Starting from the death of Biscuit, he has developed a vengeful side. He declares whoever gets in his way is his enemy and he will fight to crush them instead of fighting for survival and will press Orga into allowing him to do so. Mikazuki is very determined to destroy anyone who gets in the way of Tekkadan&#039;s, or more so Orga&#039;s, objectives.\n \n <b>Unit</b>: ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos\n ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos Lupus\n ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex\n \n (Source: Gundam.info)\n\n", "name": "Mikazuki Augus", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/328479.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/173952.jpg?s=7a629790df9e12f5d86db784550e221a", "link": "/manga/93408/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Tekketsu_no_Orphans", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans"}], "member-favorites": 533, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/75879.jpg?s=bb3a091c4097c173b36fd5cdc9939cb8", "link": "/anime/31251/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__Iron-Blooded_Orphans", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/80899.jpg?s=1a8d07ada35b73fd0e9c7e8e5439604b", "link": "/anime/33051/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__Iron-Blooded_Orphans_2nd_Season", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans 2nd Season"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e09\u65e5\u6708\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac\u30b9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/46959v.jpg", "link": "/people/15877/Kengo_Kawanishi", "name": "Kawanishi, Kengo", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/37075v.jpg", "link": "/people/20106/Ayaka_Suwa", "name": "Suwa, Ayaka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/47092v.jpg", "link": "/people/37241/Kyle_McCarley", "name": "McCarley, Kyle", "language": "English"}]}
