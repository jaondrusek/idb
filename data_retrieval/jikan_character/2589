{"about": "Kaneda's best friend since preschool and the second principal subject of the story's theme. Tetsuo is shown as a black sheep in the gang he and Kaneda are part of, and quietly suffers from a deeply rooted inferiority complex. He admires his friend yet at the same time strongly resents his own reliance upon him. After his psychokinetic abilities manifest, Tetsuo quickly becomes Kaneda's nemesis; he desires Kaneda's motorcycle (a symbol of status and power), and seeks to prove himself supremely powerful, without need of protection.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Tetsuo Shima", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/30617.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/157929.jpg?s=fa169ee1e0b8914bbd5096a53bad5c43", "link": "/manga/664/Akira", "name": "Akira"}], "member-favorites": 422, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/82596.jpg?s=97af6edd3b53d2181aff3ccbf52774d1", "link": "/anime/47/Akira", "name": "Akira"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5cf6\u9244\u96c4)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46080v.jpg", "link": "/people/286/Nozomu_Sasaki", "name": "Sasaki, Nozomu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/13209v.jpg", "link": "/people/367/Joshua_Seth", "name": "Seth, Joshua", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/2734v.jpg", "link": "/people/1661/Gerrit_Schmidt-Fo\u00df", "name": "Schmidt-Fo\u00df, Gerrit", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/34235v.jpg", "link": "/people/5138/Vagner_Fagundes", "name": "Fagundes, Vagner", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/2749v.jpg", "link": "/people/6112/Julien_Hagg\u00e9ge", "name": "Hagg\u00e9ge, Julien", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/41034v.jpg", "link": "/people/7438/Mauro_Eduardo_Lima", "name": "Lima, Mauro Eduardo", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/4734v.jpg", "link": "/people/7603/Alessandro_Quarta", "name": "Quarta, Alessandro", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/5042v.jpg", "link": "/people/7785/D\u00e1niel_Hamvas", "name": "Hamvas, D\u00e1niel", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/7200v.jpg", "link": "/people/9613/Jos\u00e9_Ot\u00e1vio_Guarnieri", "name": "Guarnieri, Jos\u00e9 Ot\u00e1vio", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/40999v.jpg", "link": "/people/10396/Jan_Rabson", "name": "Rabson, Jan", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/30941v.jpg", "link": "/people/18969/Benjam\u00edn_Rivera", "name": "Rivera, Benjam\u00edn", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/21353v.jpg", "link": "/people/18975/Albert_Trifol_Segarra", "name": "Trifol Segarra, Albert", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/29527v.jpg", "link": "/people/27889/Alexandre_Gillet", "name": "Gillet, Alexandre", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39130v.jpg", "link": "/people/36959/Carlos_Llad\u00f3", "name": "Llad\u00f3, Carlos", "language": "Spanish"}]}
