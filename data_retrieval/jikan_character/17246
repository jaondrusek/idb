He is an otaku (no matter how many times he denies it) that has information about EVERYONE in Kaimei-high. Switch appears to be the most serious of the group but his fooling around says otherwise. He also has a strong belief in Science which is shown through his rivalry against Occult lover, Yuuki Reiko. The most unique thing about Switch is that he talks through a computer which is most likely due to Psychological trauma. \n \n The reason he doesn&#039;t talk is quite possibly because he believes something he said was the cause of his younger brothers death.\n Near the end of the manga, before their graduation ceremony, Switch decides to put away his laptop and expressing his love for his friends Bossun and Himeko with his own words.\n\n", "name": "Kazuyoshi Usui", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/113840.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/143121.jpg?s=2bfa1141314ad18b82757909e03f3a56", "link": "/manga/44/Gintama", "name": "Gintama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/173959.jpg?s=497698bc14062512033368bc77c3b08c", "link": "/manga/1414/SKET_Dance", "name": "SKET Dance"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/31462.jpg?s=fec9910e5e7697df1ef216f44d9fa1be", "link": "/manga/20065/SKET_Dance", "name": "SKET Dance"}], "member-favorites": 860, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/73974.jpg?s=e9bcd4c037c98897757c310e57f0d154", "link": "/anime/9863/SKET_Dance", "name": "SKET Dance"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/50361.jpg?s=57d536f1fae272242c8937cc60a5e61c", "link": "/anime/9969/Gintama", "name": "Gintama'"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/29695.jpg?s=92a248ab9ee60bc77dfb2c7d9b28f35d", "link": "/anime/10775/SKET_Dance__Tettei_Bunseki_Special", "name": "SKET Dance: Tettei Bunseki Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/64107.jpg?s=eb2c7399d084ad8907f42854ec494137", "link": "/anime/16395/SKET_Dance_OVA", "name": "SKET Dance OVA"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7b1b\u5439 \u548c\u7fa9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/42163v.jpg", "link": "/people/2/Tomokazu_Sugita", "name": "Sugita, Tomokazu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/14283v.jpg", "link": "/people/930/Aki_Kanada", "name": "Kanada, Aki", "language": "Japanese"}]}
