{"about": "<b>Steins;Gate</b>\n Age: 19\n Height: 164 cm\n Weight: 98 kg\n Birthdate: May 19\n Blood type: B\n \n First year student in Tokyo Denki University. Pro-active otaku, who&#039;s got a thing for both 2-D and 3-D girls. Talks quite a lot, and uses @ch (a spin-off of 2ch) terminology. Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou&#039;s ridiculous requests as \"annoying,\" but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn&#039;t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn&#039;t like it when people call him Super Haker). He&#039;s always in front of the computer.\n \n Has the nickname \"Daru\" (\u30c0\u30eb), abbreviated after his name.\n \n It was later revealed in the series that he is Suzuha&#039;s father, pointed out by Mayuri.\n \n In the future of the Alpha world line, he and Okabe became the founders of the resistance against SERN&#039;s rule (in the side story \"The Far Valhalla,\" it&#039;s revealed that SERN released them after their capture so that they could found the resistance, thus completing the cycle of fate). He met his wife, a cosplayer named Amane Yuki, in the Winter Comiket after returning from SERN&#039;s headquarter in France. After Okabe was killed in 2025, he continued with the research of the time machine and invented one in 2036. After that, he was assassinated. His time machine is what Suzuha used to travel to the past, but as it was incomplete (unlike the time machine Kurisu made in 2034), it couldn&#039;t be used to travel to the future.\n (Source: naomi.thewafflehouse.net)\n \n <b>Robotics;Notes</b>\n Like Nae as well as the other Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head characters, he now works for Sawada&#039;s secret organization. When it is revealed that Iru-o cannot be trusted as it was created by Kimijima, he creates a replacement, \"DG297 3rd Edition ver.4.11.\" He also creates the virus which defeats Kimijima. He does not have any speaking roles, however, and is only mentioned in passing. As of 2019, he is already married and has a daughter. \"DaSH\" is read \"Daru the Super Hacker,\" but he temporarily calls himself \"DaSP\" (\"Daru the Super Programmer\") in the final chapter.\n\n", "name": "Itaru Hashida", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/113767.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/121341.jpg?s=b32b5faf9e172d303f2e06a291d392dd", "link": "/manga/17517/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/41878.jpg?s=082f2e8a7606b5d940aee64dcaf90e51", "link": "/manga/20699/Steins_Gate__Boukan_no_Rebellion", "name": "Steins;Gate: Boukan no Rebellion"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/150465.jpg?s=0f2f341a36103cd6c1b2e32f3dffdfa5", "link": "/manga/27965/Steins_Gate__Hiyoku_Renri_no_Sweets_Honey", "name": "Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Sweets Honey"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/46369.jpg?s=aaa7cd54b1da8ddc980befb67090a4d1", "link": "/manga/28897/Steins_Gate__Shijou_Saikyou_no_Slight_Fever", "name": "Steins;Gate: Shijou Saikyou no Slight Fever"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/149165.jpg?s=f4cfe00590a4445549b721e685035d96", "link": "/manga/28899/Steins_Gate__Onshuu_no_Brownian_Motion", "name": "Steins;Gate: Onshuu no Brownian Motion"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/133609.jpg?s=3ec5cf0c768314b8b380646c0943f9e2", "link": "/manga/35063/Robotics_Notes", "name": "Robotics;Notes"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/72649.jpg?s=09ad3cf91fcd54a85a4cacb76986236e", "link": "/manga/39859/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/83621.jpg?s=0e4115028876a9134797a7f5845f58d6", "link": "/manga/47417/Steins_Gate__Youen_no_Valhalla", "name": "Steins;Gate: Youen no Valhalla"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/84307.jpg?s=7c91513590cfe6d1b2111e770e0bb759", "link": "/manga/47825/Steins_Gate__Aishin_Meizu_no_Babel", "name": "Steins;Gate: Aishin Meizu no Babel"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/121181.jpg?s=8cd345c7c95413bdc6d2558c4109562d", "link": "/manga/49381/Steins_Gate__Heiji_Kyokusen_no_Epigraph", "name": "Steins;Gate: Heiji Kyokusen no Epigraph"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/91575.jpg?s=b34e3e144847ed210bee8bf5e9d49955", "link": "/manga/51945/Steins_Gate__Heni_Kuukan_no_Octet", "name": "Steins;Gate: Heni Kuukan no Octet"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/175916.jpg?s=f9734bda3bd9fa29ccfece9cfbb2847d", "link": "/manga/59669/Steins_Gate__Eigou_Kaiki_no_Pandora", "name": "Steins;Gate: Eigou Kaiki no Pandora"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/129319.jpg?s=17e5b9ef6b3af605cf94adfb780f7114", "link": "/manga/74595/Steins_Gate__Hiyoku_Renri_no_Future_Honey", "name": "Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Future Honey"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/198998.jpg?s=80d1bb50c4774d607c4002e6b86d736d", "link": "/manga/107548/Steins_Gate_0", "name": "Steins;Gate 0"}], "member-favorites": 635, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/73199.jpg?s=55684557b3d8bf741757d84d768beb29", "link": "/anime/9253/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/36531.jpg?s=c2adf71f17ff2563175268064765e747", "link": "/anime/10863/Steins_Gate__Oukoubakko_no_Poriomania", "name": "Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/50317.jpg?s=4ca635a9e67f3c25cbba115b171a4cd5", "link": "/anime/11577/Steins_Gate_Movie__Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D\u00e9j\u00e0_vu", "name": "Steins;Gate Movie: Fuka Ryouiki no D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/71319.jpg?s=f03a1484e5c49afa157bd3875781dc8f", "link": "/anime/27957/Steins_Gate__Soumei_Eichi_no_Cognitive_Computing", "name": "Steins;Gate: Soumei Eichi no Cognitive Computing"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/77633.jpg?s=e494cb89e0c9056698be3f29ed50e54e", "link": "/anime/30484/Steins_Gate_0", "name": "Steins;Gate 0"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/77324.jpg?s=1ef80202a3d120f192111b695e389cf3", "link": "/anime/32188/Steins_Gate__Kyoukaimenjou_no_Missing_Link_-_Divide_By_Zero", "name": "Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link -
