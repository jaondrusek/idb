{"about": "An IJN Lt. Commander whose courier plane was shot down during the Battle of Midway and rescued by Kadomatsu. He considers the encounter with the Mirai as an opportunity to change the history for the \"better\" (from his perspective, at least.) He rejects both the militarism of the Japanese Empire and shame of defeat that he attributes to the postwar Japan. Instead, he seeks to create a new undefeated Japan that he calls Zipang. While he admires the humanism of Kadomatsu, he dismisses it as a luxury unsuited for wartime and is willing to shed a great deal of blood in pursuit of his ideals.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Takumi Kusaka", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/281503.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/10584.jpg?s=648842f4ef80408f8e46d45275d73e59", "link": "/manga/191/Zipang", "name": "Zipang"}], "member-favorites": 11, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/75740.jpg?s=e35d60fea8788c96d1d335432014d152", "link": "/anime/29/Zipang", "name": "Zipang"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8349\u52a0\u62d3\u6d77)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/11404v.jpg", "link": "/people/236/Hiroki_Touchi", "name": "Touchi, Hiroki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/27789v.jpg", "link": "/people/25157/Edward_Choy_Keng_Choong", "name": "Choong, Edward Choy Keng", "language": "English"}]}
