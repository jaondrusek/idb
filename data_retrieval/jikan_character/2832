{"about": "The main character of the series, originally just another above-average student until he decided to enroll at Cromartie. Everyone else at Cromartie assumes that he's the toughest kid in school, since a rabbit would never go into a den of lions (unless it was a really badass rabbit). He has ambitions to change the school for the sake of bettering its student body.\n\n", "name": "Takashi Kamiyama", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/77976.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157310.jpg?s=ec59c95a517d0f6b938ac8ae3f65de5d", "link": "/manga/339/Sakigake_Cromartie_Koukou", "name": "Sakigake!!
