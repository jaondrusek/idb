{"about": "A classmate who sits next to the Player in class. An amiable, kind girl with a warm atmosphere to her. Her feelings are easily apparent, also laughs at the smallest of triffles. She loves reading, doing so whenever she can, but due to her enthusiasm towards books, she sometimes loses the track of time. She knows an abundance of miscellaneous which makes studying one of her strong points, on to the other side, sports and the like are far from it. She can do domestic chores decently well. Helping her mom manage her Flower&#039;s shop ever since she was small, you may catch sight of her wearing an apron when going to the shopping district. She has herself together, but she&#039;s actually dependent of others.\n\n", "name": "Honami Himekawa ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/322696.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 1, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/82088.jpg?s=feea9210999eaa1009b3dde258471e43", "link": "/anime/33981/Pretty_x_Cation_2_The_Animation", "name": "Pretty x Cation 2 The Animation"}], "name-japanese": "(\u59eb\u5ddd \u7a42\u6ce2)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/36975v.jpg", "link": "/people/8955/Yukina_Fujimori", "name": "Fujimori, Yukina", "language": "Japanese"}]}
