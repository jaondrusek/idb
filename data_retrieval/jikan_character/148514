{"about": "A young man who is the main antagonist of the \"Heisaku Underground: Dark Night\" (\u9589\u9396\u533aunderground -dark night-, Lockout Ward Underground -Dark Night-) manga. He is a violent person who enjoys picking fights, though he is shown to have a more calm and laid-back side. He is not interested in making his creator alter his world, being fine with the way he is. He fights using a wooden sword and can summon a spirit called Hangaku to fight by his side. Though he remains independent at first, he came to the aid of Souta&#039;s group against Altair&#039;s faction several times and eventually joins them.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Yuuya Mirokuji", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/322622.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/199589.jpg?s=e0e32ca02ec678efcf850b21e3620831", "link": "/manga/103727/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "member-favorites": 95, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/85469.jpg?s=5e186ab3cfff5f4da1c3c4dce4c74395", "link": "/anime/34561/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5f25\u52d2\u5bfa \u512a\u591c)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42208v.jpg", "link": "/people/5/Kenichi_Suzumura", "name": "Suzumura, Kenichi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
