{"about": "Birthday: November 10\n Height: 162 cm\n Three Sizes: 83, 59, 84\n \n Kaede Fuyou is Rin's beautiful childhood friend who grew up with him in the same house after her mother and Rin's parents died in a car accident. Some time after they started junior high school, Kaede started taking care of Rin, everything from housework to making him his meals. \n \n She is very down to earth, modest, polite and soft-spoken. However, at times she is seen showing signs of psychosis and even violence when a great shock upsets her. In the original game, this is only visible in the backstory after her mother dies, where she abuses Rin because she blames him for her mom's death while he takes her punishment so she won't fall in despair and depression. \n \n In order to atone for her actions in the past in which she mistreated Rin, Kaede decides to atone to Rin by cooking his meals and doing all the work around the house. Rin does not really want this, but he is afraid of making Kaede have a relapse by not allowing her to punish herself in this way. \n \n Kaede is shown to have romantic feelings for Rin, but considers herself unworthy to be loved by Rin or to stay by Rin's side. However, though it is not romance, Rin cares deeply about her.\n Although she has come to terms with her own feelings, she continues to love Rin, and declares this in the last episode.\n\n", "name": "Kaede Fuyou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/78795.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157292.jpg?s=beede378142dc1d1eae9d12789b3daed", "link": "/manga/1788/Shuffle", "name": "Shuffle!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/138943.jpg?s=190c98abe149564da99c7a5069b762b3", "link": "/manga/9041/Really_Really_Remember_Memories", "name": "Really?
