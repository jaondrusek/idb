{"about": "Age: 17\n Birthday: May 29\n Horoscope: Gemini\n Height: 178 cm\n \n His real name is Shoutarou. He keeps it hidden because he finds it as a very old and traditional name.His natural hair color is brown but he later bleached it blonde. He is a typical stuck-up star, and is also very ruthless. Shou had no qualms about tricking Kyouko into going with him to Tokyo so she could be a free servant for him. He also had even less qualms about being extremely cruel to her when she discovered this. Shou eventually figured out that Kyouko was in L.M.E., and was surprised to see her transformation. It is also revealed that he has more feelings for her than he originally thought, though most of these lean toward a general possessiveness for Kyouko, who had been his constant companion and servant since childhood.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Shoutarou Fuwa", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/90780.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/26110.jpg?s=91f4e5984d38c801173e2b61dfe050c6", "link": "/manga/610/Skip_Beat", "name": "Skip Beat!"}], "member-favorites": 194, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/84022.jpg?s=45aa8eb632695ba2867ee58741d17709", "link": "/anime/4722/Skip_Beat", "name": "Skip Beat!"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e0d\u7834 \u677e\u592a\u90ce)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42141v.jpg", "link": "/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano", "name": "Miyano, Mamoru", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48362v.jpg", "link": "/people/1072/Grant_George", "name": "George, Grant", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15343v.jpg", "link": "/people/14757/Won_Hyeong_Choi", "name": "Choi, Won Hyeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
