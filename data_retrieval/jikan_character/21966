{"about": "Kars is the leader of the Pillar Men. He is intelligent, ruthless, and single-minded in his dedication to obtaining the Red Stone of Aja. Strangely, despite his apathy towards humans and willingness to kill them, he has been shown to be more compassionate for other living beings. In Switzerland, he sliced a car that was about to hit a puppy in half, and later on maneuvered himself during a long fall to miss a patch of flowers near the bottom of the cliff. Kars' power is that of light; he is able to produce bladed appendages from his arms and use these to reflect blinding light toward his enemies. He also has the same powers over his body that all the Pillar Men share. \n \n When he gains the power of the stone mask, he becomes invulnerable to sunlight, and also gains some abilities on a genetic level; he can produce living creatures and control them, and can mutate his body into various forms. He outlasts his comrades and eventually does gain almost unlimited power as the ultimate \"evolved\" man through the Red Stone of Aja and a stone mask. In a final confrontation, he succeeds in severing Joseph's hand but is eventually blown into space by a volcanic eruption as well as an ultimate Ripple attack from Joseph. Being immortal, he does not die; however he is unable to return to Earth after being thrown out of orbit. Trapped in the void of space for eternity, he eventually stops thinking and desires death.\n He is named after the 80's new wave group The Cars.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Kars ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/252855.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/1630.jpg?s=93c84b24434858161ba9204bb62dc0de", "link": "/manga/1630/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_2__Sentou_Chuuryuu", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 2: Sentou Chuuryuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/82348.jpg?s=65cfa9643d298091417a77ddee753deb", "link": "/manga/46604/Jorge_Joestar", "name": "Jorge Joestar"}], "member-favorites": 93, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/40409.jpg?s=c2ce435a9929dbbea33b9aee39859b60", "link": "/anime/14719/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_TV", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken (TV)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/8315v.jpg", "link": "/people/21/Kazuhiko_Inoue", "name": "Inoue, Kazuhiko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/41723v.jpg", "link": "/people/956/John_DeMita", "name": "DeMita, John", "language": "English"}]}
