Tama would later take up Liza&#039;s family name \"Kishreshgalza\" when attending school.\n (Source: Death March Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Tama ", "image": "", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/143837.jpg?s=f270fa923ea9fdd32ab8b7f4b22d32cd", "link": "/manga/83019/Death_March_kara_Hajimaru_Isekai_Kyousoukyoku", "name": "Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/154541.jpg?s=10b425d1c184dffff3ceb5f7db6dca35", "link": "/manga/83021/Death_March_kara_Hajimaru_Isekai_Kyousoukyoku", "name": "Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku"}], "member-favorites": 3, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/88911.jpg?s=1fa9d66ab462fbaf542234d27900d82a", "link": "/anime/34497/Death_March_kara_Hajimaru_Isekai_Kyousoukyoku", "name": "Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30bf\u30de)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/37107v.jpg", "link": "/people/24267/Kaya_Okuno", "name": "Okuno, Kaya", "language": "Japanese"}]}
