{"about": "Kohane is a young medium who, at the age of 9 has been catapulted into the TV world for her powers. Although her mother is very protective of her, she believes that is only interested in her television career. After first developing her powers, she helped her mother learn that her father was having an affair, causing a drastic change in her mother&#039;s personality. She soon stops touching Kohane, doesn&#039;t refer to her by name, takes away any objects or food not considered \"pure\", and cuts off all contact with other people. She focuses on having Kohane on as many television shows as possible, and buys large amounts of extravagant items. This treatment causes Kohane to have a quiet and lonely demeanor, though she attempts to stay strong for her mother&#039;s sake, blaming everything on herself.\n \n Originally, Kohane only had the ability of seeing spirits, but thanks to one of Sakura&#039;s feathers she got the gift of purification. Later, she gives her power to Y\u016bko as payment for a wish, the wish of happiness, but the witch only takes as payment the power of purification by removing the feather that lay inside of her. Yuko grants this wish by fixing the various external problems in her life, such as her reputation. Yuko cannot fix her issues with her mother, as a person&#039;s true character can only be changed by their own will. \n\n", "name": "Kohane Tsuyuri", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/93209.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/1482.jpg?s=27f1a6adf9e8352a1dc3637135e513c4", "link": "/manga/10/xxxHOLiC", "name": "xxxHOLiC"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/168889.jpg?s=f0b5d4d333f5a50eae964635d0fc2ff8", "link": "/manga/94856/xxxHOLiC_Tokubetsu-hen", "name": "xxxHOLiC Tokubetsu-hen"}], "member-favorites": 34, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/8626.jpg?s=074c29cf31546ba1efe4daaa750c13ab", "link": "/anime/3091/xxxHOLiC_Kei", "name": "xxxHOLiC Kei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/25079.jpg?s=d10bff88f3eb633e38bebab2df15a079", "link": "/anime/4918/xxxHOLiC_Shunmuki", "name": "xxxHOLiC Shunmuki"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/25080.jpg?s=6d260e300f5dc7ba49ed8cb5c941831d", "link": "/anime/6864/xxxHOLiC_Rou", "name": "xxxHOLiC Rou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e94\u6708\u4e03\u65e5\u5c0f\u7fbd)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41540v.jpg", "link": "/people/5250/Rina_Hidaka", "name": "Hidaka, Rina", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/16033v.jpg", "link": "/people/15135/Do_Yeong_Song", "name": "Song, Do Yeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
