{"about": "Slade, by nature, is an assassin. He met Beet while he was on his three year journey, around the 2nd or 3rd year. The two are rivals to each other, but not in an angry sort of way. In the present story, he meets Beet and Poala at a port town, which later becomes the battlefield where Beet and Belltoze later fight. After said fight, he impressively holds off Belltoze from killing a weakened Beet. After a long fight, Belltoze eventually defeats him, throwing him into a building and breaking an entire wall. Slade, like Beet, uses spears when fighting. He is especially skilled at using Divine Wind, normally creating small wind shuriken or using tornadoes to attack. His strongest attack is called \"tengeki of tornado,\" where he creates an enormous tornado surrounding his enemy. He then uses his Saiga, \"Silent Grave,\" to slash at his opponent. All the while, he is moving so fast in the whirlwind that he cannot be seen. His personality is best described as quiet, not talking or doing unnecessary actions. He is basically the opposite of Beet. He is also the potential fifth member of the beet warriors.\n \n SAIGA\n \n Slade's saiga is called Silent Grave. It is a spear saiga made of wind, and compressed to a very high limit. It is so focused, that it can cut through the skin of any vandel. Another side addition is that when he summons it, its invisible, which make it looks like he is slashing at his enemies using just his hands.\n\n", "name": "Slade ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/123147.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/169816.jpg?s=9f223979d8e3743ae3ae2c9796819e62", "link": "/manga/1348/Boukenou_Beet", "name": "Boukenou Beet"}], "member-favorites": 1, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/21569.jpg?s=477abbab4b2d2b2fc46aecdfbcc4161a", "link": "/anime/8/Beet_the_Vandel_Buster", "name": "Beet the Vandel Buster"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/21570.jpg?s=320fec1bfb95ee4889d02b0eecb96e25", "link": "/anime/1123/Beet_the_Vandel_Buster_Excellion", "name": "Beet the Vandel Buster Excellion"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/16299v.jpg", "link": "/people/1526/Hiroaki_Miura", "name": "Miura, Hiroaki", "language": "Japanese"}]}
