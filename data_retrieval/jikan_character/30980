{"about": "Looker made his debut appearance in Frozen on Their Tracks. Ash and his friends met Looker while taking a train leading to Lake Acuity, and decided to help him distribute lunch boxes which he has bought too many of. He decided to investigate the reason behind the signal which caused the train to stop and discovered it was the doing of Team Galactic.\n \n He appeared again in Gateway to Ruin!, investigating Team Galactic&#039;s activities in Mt. Coronet, as well as disguising himself as a grunt to blend in.\n \n Looker made another appearance in Unlocking the Red Chain of Events!, having been captured by Team Galactic and held at the Fuego Ironworks. In DP152 Team Galactic members were arrested by him.\n \n Looker had built an alliance with Team Rocket while trying to take down Team Galactic. Jessie, James, and Meowth like to refer to him as Boxed-Lunch Guy (Japanese: Mr. Lunchbox) because he gave them boxed lunches while on the Ampharos Train. That simple act left them extremely loyal to him. \n\n", "name": "Handsome ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/109678.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/118031.jpg?s=f48c15963c6a3991504736ffe2ac16e8", "link": "/manga/7857/Pok\u00e9mon_DP__Pocket_Monsters_Diamond_Pearl_Monogatari", "name": "Pok\u00e9mon DP: Pocket Monsters Diamond Pearl Monogatari"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/36635.jpg?s=f1384f3f99b14c0fb9fe45b3622afee7", "link": "/manga/22570/Pocket_Monsters_DP", "name": "Pocket Monsters DP"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/192541.jpg?s=d588f5104e21da2721e95a7f2f70bfb1", "link": "/manga/105078/Pocket_Monsters_Special_Diamond___Pearl", "name": "Pocket Monsters Special Diamond & Pearl"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/192545.jpg?s=a8d9cd3c6d0e65479b258d561733182b", "link": "/manga/105079/Pocket_Monsters_Special_Platinum", "name": "Pocket Monsters Special Platinum"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/192548.jpg?s=98999a1c1a6d1dc038e90b8660724e3e", "link": "/manga/105082/Pocket_Monsters_Special_Black___White", "name": "Pocket Monsters Special Black & White"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/192549.jpg?s=04e867cfc6a288d70164741c5fb56bb3", "link": "/manga/105083/Pocket_Monsters_Special_Black_2___White_2", "name": "Pocket Monsters Special Black 2 & White 2"}], "member-favorites": 7, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/25749.jpg?s=99679622e07dacfd49fe114f04e40bf5", "link": "/anime/1565/Pokemon_Diamond___Pearl", "name": "Pokemon Diamond & Pearl"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/26135.jpg?s=8ed1ed307614ac37abcc769f0dd3c6a8", "link": "/anime/9107/Pokemon_Best_Wishes", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/45749.jpg?s=7b58e43664523d93bc790b7c1691cf7b", "link": "/anime/17115/Pokemon_Best_Wishes_Season_2__Episode_N", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!
