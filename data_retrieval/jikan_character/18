She cut her hair short because of a little boy who got gum stuck in it, but this action caused the Host club to mistake her for guy. However, unlike the other students, she is from a commoner family and got into Ouran through a scholarship. On her first day at school, she accidentally breaks a vase worth 8 million yen belonging to the Host Club. As a result, she is forced to work as a host to pay off her debt, and does so by disguising herself as a boy. Soon enough, she naturally takes to acting as a host to other girls, and even finds it enjoyable. However, she does not like to take time away from studying and often finds the antics of the other hosts to be annoying. Haruhi lives with her okama (cross dressing) father. As a result of her mother passing away when she was young, Haruhi has become very independent and never lets anyone worry about her. Although seemingly unflappable, she has a fear of thunderstorms.\n \n Haruhi was very popular back in middle school, and was confessed to at least once a month. However, like Tamaki, she is very dense when it comes to love, and has broken many hearts unintentionally. Later in the manga, she realizes her love for Tamaki, and begins to blush whenever he is around.\n \n Eventually she leaves Japan to study abroad and, of course, the whole club joins her (even Honey and Mori!). In the last chapter of the manga there's a picture of Tamaki and her getting married.\n\n", "name": "Haruhi Fujioka", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/55779.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/19240.jpg?s=8b4e16c145de8d076de1e7a522f73252", "link": "/manga/30/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33182.jpg?s=16a536c8097bc213d65d6909933da9c0", "link": "/manga/20777/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/39258.jpg?s=740f334574cfcccebe6ee3759e5262f2", "link": "/manga/24339/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_Short_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club Short Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/59387.jpg?s=a1eb51dff2dab27b13cb812a81763734", "link": "/manga/27029/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_University_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club University Special"}], "member-favorites": 4992, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/71992.jpg?s=721d5f3166e936ee69187e4bc004f319", "link": "/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}], "name-japanese": "(\u85e4\u5ca1\u30cf\u30eb\u30d2)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44284v.jpg", "link": "/people/90/Maaya_Sakamoto", "name": "Sakamoto, Maaya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40237v.jpg", "link": "/people/313/Caitlin_Glass", "name": "Glass, Caitlin", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15825v.jpg", "link": "/people/14993/Ji_Yeong_Lee", "name": "Lee, Ji Yeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
