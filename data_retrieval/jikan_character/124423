{"about": "Shin was the Eighth Generation Yakumo&#039;s lifelong friend and partner growing up, and Konatsu&#039;s father. Apprenticed under Yakumo Yuurakutei alongside Bon, he was originally given the name \"Hatsutarou,\" but rejected it to instead perform under the name \"Sukeroku.\" As a shin&#039;uchi, his unique and passionate style of performing quickly earns him a name and reputation in the rakugo community, but also strikes a nerve with the traditionalist members of the rakugo association.\n \n Sukeroku and Kikuhiko made a promise with each other to ensure rakugo&#039;s survival as an art form together&mdash;Sukeroku would practice rakugo that changed to appeal to the public and Kikuhiko would practice rakugo that never changed and stayed true to its roots. This promise would go unfulfilled when Sukeroku died a tragic death at a young age, but his impact on rakugo as an art never faded.\n \n As a penniless abandoned child, Shin found himself drawn to a rakugo street performer named Sukeroku, who trained him&mdash;making Shin the Second Generation Sukeroku. In his prime, the First Generation Sukeroku was apprenticed alongside the Seventh Generation Yakumo, who sabotaged him and caused his downfall.\n \n When Sukeroku was forced to leave the Yuurakutei household due to both his callous disregard for higher-ranked rakugo performers and Yakumo&#039;s own insecurities, he eloped with Miyokichi, with whom he fathered Konatsu. Sukeroku and Miyokichi both died in the titular lovers&#039; suicide.\n\n", "name": "Sukeroku Yuurakutei", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/301594.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/149738.jpg?s=473fd882ae0f6d469d78c2d6b3929ba0", "link": "/manga/26704/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu", "name": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu"}], "member-favorites": 145, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/66057.jpg?s=8748df6c167b3366a53af23f888abc27", "link": "/anime/25801/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu__Yotarou_Hourou-hen", "name": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Yotarou Hourou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/77907.jpg?s=31d9f14b959dcb4265533713bbf0a1ac", "link": "/anime/28735/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu", "name": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/82947.jpg?s=212d36924bed28f40c7d7f7240fb7327", "link": "/anime/33095/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu__Sukeroku_Futatabi-hen", "name": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6709\u697d\u4ead \u52a9\u516d)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44674v.jpg", "link": "/people/11/Kouichi_Yamadera", "name": "Yamadera, Kouichi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
