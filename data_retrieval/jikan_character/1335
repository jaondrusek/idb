{"about": "Birthdate: November 4, 0064 U.C. \n Height: 168cm (MSG), 180cm (MSG-CC) \n Age: 15 (MSG), 23 (MSG-Z), 29 (MSG-CC) \n \n Amuro was born on Earth and raised in the space colonies of Side 7. Amuro's father is an Earth Federation technician who helps the Federation build new weapon designs. Since he has seen many of his fathers work, he's a very skilled technician himself. As soon as Zeon attacked the colony he was living in, he came across the RX-78-2 Gundam and used it to stop them.\n \n After countless battles Amuro learned of his Newtype abilities, and was considered one of the strongest mobile suit pilots. Since the Gundam was white he was considered the White Ghost by many of his enemies. \n \n After the One Year War, Amuro was placed under house arrest by the Titan forces, believing that he would join the AEUG. Eventually that is what Amuro did and was able to escape Titan hands with some help from his friend Fraw Bow. He teams up with Kamille and teaches him the ways of a Newtype, but he can't help but feel jealous that he's no longer considered the famous Gundam pilot. \n \n After the war between the Titans and the AEUG, Amuro returns to the E.F.S.F. to fight against the Neo Zeon threat. He becomes part of the Londo Bell forces with Bright Noa. \n \n Soon Amuro became one of the E.F.S.F. best pilots and was given higher honor among all soldiers of the E.F.S.F.\n\n", "name": "Amuro Ray", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/107004.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/6308.jpg?s=c887630183317b9b210194c695c128ad", "link": "/manga/206/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_0079", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam 0079"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/151300.jpg?s=351a873bd078e25b7f789eb5a9ff36a7", "link": "/manga/214/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__The_Origin", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: The Origin"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/148121.jpg?s=ace3b2581ee4cc1e775ed61efac97f65", "link": "/manga/9889/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/72045.jpg?s=68047336bd8b64865916c2f675efa68c", "link": "/manga/28007/Kidou_Senshi_vs_Densetsu_Kyojin__Gyakushuu_no_Gigantis", "name": "Kidou Senshi vs Densetsu Kyojin: Gyakushuu no Gigantis"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/148119.jpg?s=bc17f789991014124638b3588429c80f", "link": "/manga/30593/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Gyakushuu_no_Char_-_Beltorchikas_Children", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gyakushuu no Char -
