{"about": "A heavy-drinking middle-aged lady in room #1 of Ikkoku-kan. She is from Hokkaido. Aside from the fact that she's a party animal, she is typical of her age: in one word, nosy. When she still didn't know that Kyoko was a widow, she was trying very hard to arrange an \"omiai\" (a formal introduction to another person, in the hopes they would develop a relationship and marry each other) for Kyoko.
