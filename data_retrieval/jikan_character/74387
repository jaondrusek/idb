{"about": "Race: Fallen Angel\n Ranking: Former Governor General of the Fallen Angels\n Affiliations: Kuoh Academy (Teacher), Occult Research Club (Advisor)\n First Appearance: Volume 4\n \n It is hard to determine Azazel&#039;s personality, as he is laid back and serious, also wise and insane, all at the same time. Azazel is a research fanatic, especially on Sacred Gears. He is also pacifistic, preferring to talk his way out of troubles rather than resorting to violence. He has been shown to care deeply for his fellow Fallen Angels, Shemhazai and Baraqiel. He is also very charismatic, able to endear his Fallen Angel followers. \n \n Azazel also has complicated feelings on the fact that many of his friends and acquaintances are all married and have a family. It is suggested that Azazel is a pervert, with his fondness for breasts, and the fact he has stated to have had harems over the millennia. Not to mention his stated reason for becoming a Fallen Angel all those millennia ago was lust.\n \n Originally an Angel from Heaven, during his time there, Azazel had once written a report on his Artificial Sacred Gear, the Blazer Shining Aura Darkness Blade, which was published by Michael much to his embarrassment. Azazel later lost his place in the Heavens after having sex with a human woman and became a Fallen Angel as punishment from God. Shortly after that, he created the Fallen Angels&#039; organization, Grigori, and became its Governor General. During the Great War between the Three Factions, the Fallen Angels were the first to retreat due to Azazel&#039;s order after he had lost many of his subordinates. After retreating from the Great War, Azazel starts to research on Sacred Gears, creating Artificial Sacred Gears. He also made a contract with one of the Five Great Dragon Kings, Fafnir, during his research on Sacred Gears.\n \n Azazel makes his first appearance in Volume 4, introducing himself to Issei. He later attended the meeting between the leaders of the three factions and was the one to proposed the peace treaty.\n\n", "name": "Azazel ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/242115.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/175003.jpg?s=1d00023273bb401914a136ed3d74bbff", "link": "/manga/25409/High_School_DxD", "name": "High School DxD"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/57421.jpg?s=7bd094ee19566065553e1f7d5b3ac382", "link": "/manga/30859/High_School_DxD", "name": "High School DxD"}], "member-favorites": 176, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/47729.jpg?s=83d77e3b25b450cecf174cb302c3359a", "link": "/anime/15451/High_School_DxD_New", "name": "High School DxD New"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/73642.jpg?s=fbef954c36de8290b6bf696bcf1a1358", "link": "/anime/24703/High_School_DxD_BorN", "name": "High School DxD BorN"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/73605.jpg?s=06dda4e721a7a86eb046ac9c4ec3781f", "link": "/anime/30300/High_School_DxD_New__Oppai_Tsutsumimasu", "name": "High School DxD New: Oppai, Tsutsumimasu!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/88545.jpg?s=2a3d5b69727f9c4ce6e7031441330789", "link": "/anime/34281/High_School_DxD_Hero", "name": "High School DxD Hero"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30b6\u30bc\u30eb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/10115v.jpg", "link": "/people/113/Rikiya_Koyama", "name": "Koyama, Rikiya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39706v.jpg", "link": "/people/7522/Phil_Parsons", "name": "Parsons, Phil", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48309v.jpg", "link": "/people/44978/Simon_Derksen", "name": "Derksen, Simon", "language": "German"}]}
