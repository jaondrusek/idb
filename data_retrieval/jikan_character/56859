{"about": "<b>Age</b>: 16 Years Old\n <b>Class</b>: 1st Year High School Student\n <b>Height</b>: 168 cm (5'6\")\n <b>Weight</b>: 57 kg\n \n Kaoru is a brainy young man who moved during the summer of his first year in high school, from Yokosuka to his uncle's house in Kyushu. In fact, Kaoru has been moving from place to place ever since he was a little kid, a lifestyle that has made him introverted. But after Kaoru encounters Sentaro, he started to change, all while learning the joys of jazz. Kaoru has been familiar with classical music for many years and is quite the pianist, so naturally he's on piano.\n\n", "name": "Kaoru Nishimi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/160877.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/62627.jpg?s=0c08f841788e1a0064a1eccdc0354809", "link": "/manga/28393/Sakamichi_no_Apollon", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/82944.jpg?s=9b4f61c23febe38a489dd1b7e006e017", "link": "/manga/47022/Sakamichi_no_Apollon__Bonus_Track", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon: Bonus Track"}], "member-favorites": 253, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/79781.jpg?s=414355e27eaed55465b6faa58db43781", "link": "/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon"}], "name-japanese": "(\u897f\u898b\u85ab)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23615v.jpg", "link": "/people/190/Chris_Patton", "name": "Patton, Chris", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37879v.jpg", "link": "/people/1762/Ryouhei_Kimura", "name": "Kimura, Ryouhei", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42679v.jpg", "link": "/people/12388/Nozomi_Furuki", "name": "Furuki, Nozomi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49214v.jpg", "link": "/people/45700/Micha\u00ebl_Maino", "name": "Maino, Micha\u00ebl", "language": "French"}]}
