He is a year younger than his older sister, Yuki.\n \n Later in the movie, Ame wants to be a wild wolf instead of a normal human like Yuki.\n \n Ame later goes onto living in the mountains to pursue his dream of living as a wild lone wolf and to follow in his teacher&#039;s footprints, while guarding the mountain and his territory. He would sometimes call out to his mother in the wind of the mountains.\n\n", "name": "Ame ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/161479.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/165496.jpg?s=df052e92d5d4c4bdfaef249d40298243", "link": "/manga/40761/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki", "name": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"}], "member-favorites": 226, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/35721.jpg?s=c4248ac158d12653f67e3a0d67dc3194", "link": "/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki", "name": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"}], "name-japanese": "(\u96e8)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/40833v.jpg", "link": "/people/479/Alison_Viktorin", "name": "Viktorin, Alison", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23753v.jpg", "link": "/people/8686/Micah_Solusod", "name": "Solusod, Micah", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/19057v.jpg", "link": "/people/16543/Yukito_Nishii", "name": "Nishii, Yukito", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/20277v.jpg", "link": "/people/17713/Amon_Kabe", "name": "Kabe, Amon", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/22433v.jpg", "link": "/people/20268/Alessio_Puccio", "name": "Puccio, Alessio", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48085v.jpg", "link": "/people/20332/Ariadna_Jim\u00e9nez", "name": "Jim\u00e9nez, Ariadna", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32025v.jpg", "link": "/people/30737/Herv\u00e9_Grull", "name": "Grull, Herv\u00e9", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39141v.jpg", "link": "/people/36980/Christian_Zeiger", "name": "Zeiger, Christian", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/45991v.jpg", "link": "/people/42628/Barbara_Sacchelli", "name": "Sacchelli, Barbara", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48037v.jpg", "link": "/people/44562/Bruno_Cafaggi_Paix\u00e3o", "name": "Cafaggi Paix\u00e3o, Bruno", "language": "Brazilian"}]}
