{"about": "Ohjiro Mihara is Ichiro(Icchan) Mihara's younger stepbrother. He has been involved with Angelic Layer for many years, in a large part because it was what brought him and Icchan together after their parents married each other. Ohjiro competes in Kobe and has been the champion of the Kansai Regional games, as well as being the runner-up in the national tournament for two consecutive years. He has a desperate desire to defeat Shuko Suzuhara's angel Athena to get over a childhood crush he had on her. His angel is Wizard, his special ability is Magic Guard. In the anime Ohjiro and Misaki even go on a date in episode 22. Then it is not until episode 23 that he confesses to Misaki that he is falling in love with her.\n \n Wikipedia.com \n\n", "name": "Ohjiro Mihara", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/110144.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/27076.jpg?s=a0506355b54f96cc8eea98364c86de72", "link": "/manga/9/Tsubasa__RESERVoir_CHRoNiCLE", "name": "Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/179060.jpg?s=4d992b777066a4ca5f40fd19d691e8bb", "link": "/manga/80/Angelic_Layer", "name": "Angelic Layer"}], "member-favorites": 14, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/23379.jpg?s=c81d1e2d58e23d89883672b8c18a73ca", "link": "/anime/52/Kidou_Tenshi_Angelic_Layer", "name": "Kidou Tenshi Angelic Layer"}], "name-japanese": "(\u4e09\u539f\u738b\u4e8c\u90ce)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44478v.jpg", "link": "/people/30/Soichiro_Hoshi", "name": "Hoshi, Soichiro", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23615v.jpg", "link": "/people/190/Chris_Patton", "name": "Patton, Chris", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/3071v.jpg", "link": "/people/5486/Enzo_Fortuny", "name": "Fortuny, Enzo", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40358v.jpg", "link": "/people/10706/Dirk_Petrick", "name": "Petrick, Dirk", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15465v.jpg", "link": "/people/14867/Jang_Kim", "name": "Kim, Jang", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28677v.jpg", "link": "/people/26561/Nicolas_Beaucaire", "name": "Beaucaire, Nicolas", "language": "French"}]}
