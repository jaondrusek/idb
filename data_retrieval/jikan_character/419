{"about": "Birthday: 17/07/5008\n \n A mysterious nobleman living in luxury, The Count approaches and befriends Albert in Luna as the first step in his plan of revenge against the people who once betrayed him.\n \n The Count&#039;s previous identity was Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a sailor who worked for the Morrel family&#039;s shipping company. Edmond was imprisoned in the Ch&acirc;teau d&#039;If on false charges, and it was there that he met Gankutsuou (known as The Ruler of the Cave in Animax&#039;s English adaptation). In exchange for the strength and means to gain revenge, he allowed the cold-blooded demon to possess him. Because of Gankutsuou, he is afflicted with an odd condition which causes his body to be crystalline, revealing his bones and internal organs.\n\n", "name": "The Count of Monte Cristo ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/102102.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/19005.jpg?s=b2b2c84e14bf3eba095decb6827d29b4", "link": "/manga/4519/Gankutsuou", "name": "Gankutsuou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/101605.jpg?s=3b64627ed49ff324336270aebb6de26c", "link": "/manga/58679/Gankutsuou", "name": "Gankutsuou"}], "member-favorites": 1284, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/2235.jpg?s=025ba0ad2ae4c8ec3be456aee04ce5c9", "link": "/anime/239/Gankutsuou", "name": "Gankutsuou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u4f2f\u7235)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44266v.jpg", "link": "/people/91/Jouji_Nakata", "name": "Nakata, Jouji", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/38697v.jpg", "link": "/people/353/Jamieson_Price", "name": "Price, Jamieson", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/33055v.jpg", "link": "/people/1179/Antoine_Tome", "name": "Tome, Antoine", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/5613v.jpg", "link": "/people/8415/Levente_K\u00e1rp\u00e1ti", "name": "K\u00e1rp\u00e1ti, Levente", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/21165v.jpg", "link": "/people/11101/Russell_Wait", "name": "Wait, Russell", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32273v.jpg", "link": "/people/15099/Si_Ho_Hong", "name": "Hong, Si Ho", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/18885/\u00d3scar_Redondo", "name": "Redondo, \u00d3scar", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42350v.jpg", "link": "/people/40353/Paulo_Celestino", "name": "Celestino, Paulo", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46498v.jpg", "link": "/people/43003/Raffaele_Farina", "name": "Farina, Raffaele", "language": "Italian"}]}
