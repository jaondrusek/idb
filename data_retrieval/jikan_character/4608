{"about": "Birthdate: September 9\n Height: 159 cm\n Weight: 47 kg\n Sign: Virgo\n Blood type: O\n \n Ryou is Tomoya's classmate and class representative. She is the younger of the Fujibayashi twins. Unlike her twin sister, she is timid and doesn't cook well, though she is good with other household chores. Ryou is very keen about fortune telling, but her predictions, while incredibly specific, always manage to be either somewhat skewed or extremely wrong. She aspires to become a nurse.\n \n Ryou actually has a crush on Tomoya. She finds out that her twin sister, Kyou, loves him too, but uses her sister's help despite that. Ryou gradually gets over her crush when she realizes that Tomoya's true love will always be Nagisa (and in the Another arc, it would be Tomoyo).\n In ~After Story~\n Ryou becomes a nurse and is seen working toward the end of the series.\n In Another World: Kyou Chapter\n Knowing that Tomoya loves Kyou, Ryou gives up on Tomoya and tells Kyou to confess to him.\n\n", "name": "Ryou Fujibayashi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/256501.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/6142.jpg?s=cb14719c95af7419659e411f1b30be0e", "link": "/manga/2598/Clannad", "name": "Clannad"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/6798.jpg?s=42d173173df5eb1fc62c1e0b34427f2c", "link": "/manga/5390/Clannad_4-koma_Manga_Gekijyou", "name": "Clannad 4-koma Manga Gekijyou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/162583.jpg?s=2f5e11641490096e2726a7f9564ed0a9", "link": "/manga/6997/Clannad__Hikaru_Mimamoru_Sakamichi_de", "name": "Clannad: Hikaru Mimamoru Sakamichi de"}], "member-favorites": 214, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/8498.jpg?s=e835da8f54fd2e1f000e95d691738656", "link": "/anime/2167/Clannad", "name": "Clannad"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/24647.jpg?s=86ee99f711f4ca7f6ba306e600f9961c", "link": "/anime/4181/Clannad__After_Story", "name": "Clannad: After Story"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/19621.jpg?s=7fdf1dcd006eb44bcc0e90d11524ac54", "link": "/anime/6351/Clannad__After_Story_-_Mou_Hitotsu_no_Sekai_Kyou-hen", "name": "Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u85e4\u6797 \u690b)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/21349v.jpg", "link": "/people/239/Akemi_Kanda", "name": "Kanda, Akemi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/34809v.jpg", "link": "/people/414/Brittney_Karbowski", "name": "Karbowski, Brittney", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15621v.jpg", "link": "/people/14921/Seon_Yeong_Park", "name": "Park, Seon Yeong", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/34295v.jpg", "link": "/people/33329/Melinda_Rachfahl", "name": "Rachfahl, Melinda", "language": "German"}]}
