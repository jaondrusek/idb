{"about": "A replica of a dimensional god Mokona made by Clow Reed and Yuuko.\n \n Soel was created specifically for Sakura, as a counter-measure for certain events foretold to happen in her journey by Clow Reed. It is \"the thing\" given to tsubasa crew as a means to travel between dimensions.\n \n Soel, is more energetic and cheerful than its counterpart, Black Mokona, Larg. Soel likes to tease the tsubasa team members, especially Kurogane.\n \n Soel's main functions include dimensional travel, universal translator and communicating with Black Mokona. It is later revealed that these functions are part of his \"108 Secret Skills\".\n \n Soel bears an earring on her right ear, while Larg has one on his left ear.\n \n The Earring is later revealed to contain one-time ability to \"repel\" magical curses. However the ability itself was not explained.\n \n In Horitsuba Gakuen, she is a twin with Mokona.\n \n (This is not the same Mokona which appears in CLAMP's other work, Rayearth.)\n\n", "name": "Mokona Modoki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/53075.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/27076.jpg?s=a0506355b54f96cc8eea98364c86de72", "link": "/manga/9/Tsubasa__RESERVoir_CHRoNiCLE", "name": "Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/1482.jpg?s=27f1a6adf9e8352a1dc3637135e513c4", "link": "/manga/10/xxxHOLiC", "name": "xxxHOLiC"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/22065.jpg?s=14aa4a3a8c7539781b72c9f6c32c4555", "link": "/manga/14368/Shiritsu_Horitsuba_Gakuen", "name": "Shiritsu Horitsuba Gakuen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/151905.jpg?s=ee16f99d1614d096a02ed97b31cb1555", "link": "/manga/74339/Tsubasa__WoRLD_CHRoNiCLE_-_Niraikanai-hen", "name": "Tsubasa: WoRLD CHRoNiCLE - Niraikanai-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/151903.jpg?s=d3216fa420bacc56f26d775097f97315", "link": "/manga/86232/Tsubasa__WoRLD_CHRoNiCLE_-_Niraikanai-hen_Shucchouban", "name": "Tsubasa: WoRLD CHRoNiCLE - Niraikanai-hen Shucchouban"}], "member-favorites": 538, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/6555.jpg?s=69f5dc40b4b389360148939ea771b2a7", "link": "/anime/177/Tsubasa_Chronicle", "name": "Tsubasa Chronicle"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/45953.jpg?s=64eb944ef4e9938db7a0a283f1810ca4", "link": "/anime/807/Tsubasa_Chronicle__Tori_Kago_no_Kuni_no_Himegimi", "name": "Tsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no Himegimi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/21858.jpg?s=e5ad13d37606c639a00e16da6446de67", "link": "/anime/861/xxxHOLiC", "name": "xxxHOLiC"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/6554.jpg?s=213317b3a0bc9fefc48c679dea49d650", "link": "/anime/969/Tsubasa_Chronicle_2nd_Season", "name": "Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/49129.jpg?s=f3ff8ac8152598e69c61d9665b22e00b", "link": "/anime/2685/Tsubasa__Tokyo_Revelations", "name": "Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelations"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/59503.jpg?s=2ff7560ae0543a4916df3db5e47a2bc0", "link": "/anime/2768/CLAMP_in_Wonderland_2", "name": "CLAMP in Wonderland 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/33841.jpg?s=c4bc5579f9f051bf4e09bdf21d94e6ac", "link": "/anime/4938/Tsubasa__Shunraiki", "name": "Tsubasa: Shunraiki"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/79838.jpg?s=c68b4e3d1fb4cfa39f2fceca6f599eab", "link": "/anime/5678/Kobato", "name": "Kobato."}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e2\u30b3\u30ca\uff1d\u30e2\u30c9\u30ad)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/20875v.jpg", "link": "/people/291/Yuri_Shiratori", "name": "Shiratori, Yuri", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/6771v.jpg", "link": "/people/327/Carrie_Savage", "name": "Savage, Carrie", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49341v.jpg", "link": "/people/375/Mika_Kikuchi", "name": "Kikuchi, Mika", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/5197v.jpg", "link": "/people/6106/Rubina_Kuraoka", "name": "Kuraoka, Rubina", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/4129v.jpg", "link": "/people/7228/Diana_Torres", "name": "Torres, Diana", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/8544v.jpg", "link": "/people/10232/Lileana_Chac\u00f3n", "name": "Chac\u00f3n, Lileana", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/11093/Sarah_Hauser", "name": "Hauser, Sarah", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/46154/Roser_Vilches", "name": "Vilches, Roser", "language": "Spanish"}]}
