After trying to rescue a cat, she was badly injured in a car accident, which led to the loss of her right eye and some of her internal organs. The only way to save her life would be to have someone with the same blood type transfer their organs to her. She did not care whether she lived or not, and her mother refused to sacrifice her own organs anyway. However, Mukuro Rokudo heard her words and allowed her to live by creating illusionary organs.\n \n Due to her once anti-social life as Nagi, she never opens up to anyone except Mukuro, and always gets confused and shy when someone is kind to her since she had never imagined that her existence could be accepted by people. Because of her nature, some people can&#039;t be honest with her or think of her as pitiful. She also lacked confidence and used to tend on Mukuro for help, despite her own desire to become stronger. However, as the story progress, she becomes determined to become independent to help the people who are dear to her with her own power and started to interact with the others. Her main goal is to one day converse with Mukuro in Italian.\n \n Chrome is a talented illusionist and fighter, something that Mukuro has pointed out, stating that she has a quality to become independent soldier. Even though at first she&#039;s mostly assisted by Mukuro, her own illusions gradually improves to the point only an expert can see through it, as stated by Mammon. This further proven when she&#039;s able to create illusionary organs with her own power and supported Mukuro&#039;s illusions that even Mukuro commented to be stronger from Flan.\n \n The Japanese roumaji of her name, Kuroumu Dokuro, is an anagram of Mukuro Rokudo.\n\n", "name": "Chrome Dokuro", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/47170.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/32291.jpg?s=60465135abcf67b6754ef0f6152b34ef", "link": "/manga/47/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn", "name": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/26013.jpg?s=24a720f922d48d8aaff1d254819fe449", "link": "/manga/17288/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn_Secret_Bullet", "name": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!
