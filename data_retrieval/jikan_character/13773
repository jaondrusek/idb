{"about": "Migi is the Parasite which lives in Shinichi&#039;s hand. Unlike \"successful\" Parasites, Migi has no desire to kill humans for sustenance, and is nourished by the food Shinichi eats. Migi is, like other Parasites, completely without emotion. His primary consideration is survival, and he has threatened (and in some cases attempted) to kill other humans who pose a threat to his and Shinichi&#039;s secrecy. When he and Shinichi were first coming to terms, he even threatened to remove Shinichi&#039;s other limbs in order to render him unable to place the two of them in danger. Migi can be reasoned with, however, and has just as much reason to be mistrustful of other Parasites as does Shinichi. On the other hand, unlike Shinichi, Migi has no inclination to place himself at risk in order to protect other humans from Parasites. \n \n As the series goes along, however, he becomes more human, whereas the reverse happens to Shinichi.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Migi ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/268993.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/188928.jpg?s=11c3eb1ba655fc95f0c916541945852c", "link": "/manga/401/Kiseijuu", "name": "Kiseijuu"}], "member-favorites": 2433, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/73178.jpg?s=65771e52d9c917f62db9a3150aa15c8a", "link": "/anime/22535/Kiseijuu__Sei_no_Kakuritsu", "name": "Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30df\u30ae\u30fc)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/47927v.jpg", "link": "/people/4/Aya_Hirano", "name": "Hirano, Aya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/34809v.jpg", "link": "/people/414/Brittney_Karbowski", "name": "Karbowski, Brittney", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20315v.jpg", "link": "/people/17719/Monica_Bertolotti", "name": "Bertolotti, Monica", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/47785v.jpg", "link": "/people/26417/Sandra_Vandroux", "name": "Vandroux, Sandra", "language": "French"}]}
