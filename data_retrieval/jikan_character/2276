{"about": "Age: 7 (Digimon movie part one), 11 (Digimon 01), 14 (Digimon 02), 17 (Digimon Tri.)\n Birthday: 1988 October 25\n \n Sora is a very reliable person and tries to take care of the other kids, like a mother would. Her father works as a professor at the Kyoto University and in Digimon Adventure 02 it is seen that Shuu, one of Kido Jou&#039;s older brothers, does research at the university with Sora&#039;s father. \n \n Because of her father&#039;s work at Kyoto, she usually lives only with her mother, who owns a flower shop. Sora is partnered with Piyomon and is the bearer of the Crest of Love.\n \n When Sora was young, she lived in Hikarigaoka with her family. She attended Dai-san Elementary School and was in the same first grade class as Yagami Taichi. In 1995, she witnessed the fight between Greymon and Parrotmon. After this, her family moved to Odaiba. \n \n Sora was very tomboyish, being the only girl in the school&#039;s soccer team, where she was the teammate of Yagami Taichi and Izumi Koushiro. A caring person, she was very protective of the group, and acted almost as a motherly figure, especially to Tachikawa Mimi and Takaishi Takeru. She often acted as a voice of reason to the others, especially during Taichi and Ishida Yamato&#039;s arguments.\n \n When Taichi and Metal Greymon disappeared following the defeat of Etemon, Sora and Piyomon were the first to split from the group, in search of Taichi. They overheard Pico Devimon discussing the Crests with Vamdemon, and Pico Devimon, who found them out, told Sora that her own Crest will never activate because she doesn&#039;t know real love. Sora certainly felt that way; Sora&#039;s father was mostly absent, spending most of his time teaching in Kyoto, and she often argued with her mother, Toshiko, who wanted Sora to quit soccer and study the art of flower arranging. \n \n Sora and Piyomon ended up traveling and helping the other separated Chosen Children from behind the scenes, until Taichi brought them all together and convinced her to rejoin them. As Vamdemon attacked the group head-on, Piyomon was injured but tried to fight despite this. Sora tried to hold her back, and realized that in trying to protect Piyomon, she was just like her mother. Realizing that her mother does love her and care for her triggered her Crest of Love, and the newly-evolved Garudamon drove Vamdemon off. Finally, Sora was able to make peace with her mother.\n When the children were fighting the Dark Masters and split up again, Sora was extremely protective of everyone in her group and tried to put everything on herself, even when she couldn&#039;t handle it. This eventually led her to trap herself in a dark cave like Yamato who, along with Kido Jou, eventually helped her escape.\n \n In May 2000,(between Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02) Sora arrived in the Digital World and gave up her Crest power to free the Four Holy Beasts. As a result, Piyomon lost the power to evolve to Perfect. By the time 02 starts, Sora has learned to embrace her feminine side and grew closer to her mother. From her mother, she started learning flower arranging, and also started playing tennis, joining the tennis club at school.\n \n On Christmas Eve, Sora decided to bring homemade cookies to Yamato before he went to the concert, meaning to tell him that she liked him. She was a bit uncomfortable when Taichi showed up before she went backstage, but Taichi encouraged her to do so. From then on, she and Yamato were a couple.\n \n 25 Years Later, by the year 2027, Sora is married to Yamato and has become a fashion designer. She has a daughter who resembles Yamato and has a Pyocomon, and a son who looks more like her, and has a Tunomon.\n\n", "name": "Sora Takenouchi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/86723.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 139, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/11070.jpg?s=662f1a738b56784ae5446d3d4bc0b53c", "link": "/anime/552/Digimon_Adventure", "name": "Digimon Adventure"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/20360.jpg?s=b03279a6d09a3d2f4a64abecd92f8851", "link": "/anime/1313/Digimon_Adventure_02", "name": "Digimon Adventure 02"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/72451.jpg?s=d8d84b044c78c9ad94545c956f4a1f8b", "link": "/anime/2397/Digimon_Adventure__Bokura_no_War_Game", "name": "Digimon Adventure: Bokura no War Game!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/82620.jpg?s=173c0b3998b09d2de3e9db42c6561eff", "link": "/anime/2398/Digimon_Adventure_02__Diablomon_no_Gyakushuu", "name": "Digimon Adventure 02: Diablomon no Gyakushuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/72452.jpg?s=a02f2b517007f07db647534c7646e784", "link": "/anime/2961/Digimon_Adventure_Movie", "name": "Digimon Adventure Movie"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/82960.jpg?s=17511d0ec731384304d93ffbfd478642", "link": "/anime/2962/Digimon_Adventure_02_Movies", "name": "Digimon Adventure 02 Movies"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75493.jpg?s=5b27ba98b0f57dc42f26ac8d306f62a0", "link": "/anime/25687/Digimon_Adventure_tri_1__Saikai", "name": "Digimon Adventure tri. 1: Saikai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/77425.jpg?s=8d6e3e2a7111a70736d5158afb56768b", "link": "/anime/32108/Digimon_Adventure_tri_2__Ketsui", "name": "Digimon Adventure tri. 2: Ketsui"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/82612.jpg?s=ae0bf8e358cd0c09e72dcb31bf801b82", "link": "/anime/32551/Digimon_Adventure_tri_3__Kokuhaku", "name": "Digimon Adventure tri. 3: Kokuhaku"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/82613.jpg?s=a5293a981f28c7c700b0ef030bd15294", "link": "/anime/34299/Digimon_Adventure_tri_4__Soushitsu", "name": "Digimon Adventure tri. 4: Soushitsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/85166.jpg?s=431c5f1663b7eeb1e326cfb0f9bce322", "link": "/anime/34962/Digimon_Adventure_tri_5__Kyousei", "name": "Digimon Adventure tri. 5: Kyousei"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6b66\u4e4b\u5185 \u7a7a)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39297v.jpg", "link": "/people/264/Colleen_Villard", "name": "Villard, Colleen", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44380v.jpg", "link": "/people/485/Yuuko_Mizutani", "name": "Mizutani, Yuuko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/20541v.jpg", "link": "/people/5105/Priscila_Amorim", "name": "Amorim, Priscila", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/2771v.jpg", "link": "/people/6140/Sonja_Spuhl", "name": "Spuhl, Sonja", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/5063v.jpg", "link": "/people/7809/Kriszta_N\u00e9meth", "name": "N\u00e9meth, Kriszta", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/23681v.jpg", "link": "/people/11359/Suzuko_Mimori", "name": "Mimori, Suzuko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/20135v.jpg", "link": "/people/17751/Nurit_Banai_corne", "name": "Banai corne, Nurit", "language": "Hebrew"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20825v.jpg", "link": "/people/18327/Circe_Luna", "name": "Luna, Circe", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/38243v.jpg", "link": "/people/23705/Valeria_Vidali", "name": "Vidali, Valeria", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/24237/Annabelle_Roux", "name": "Roux, Annabelle", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49735v.jpg", "link": "/people/46202/Marta_S\u00e1inz", "name": "S\u00e1inz, Marta", "language": "Spanish"}]}
