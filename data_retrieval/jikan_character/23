{"about": "Age: 17\n Birthday: November 22\n Height: 180 cm (5&#039; 11\")\n Blood Type: AB\n Host Type: \"Cool\"\n Zodiac Sign: Scorpio\n Favorite Subjects: English, German, Physics\n Favorite Foods: Anything spicy, nothing sweet\n Rose Color: violet\n \n Kyouya Ootori, a second year student at Ouran Gakuen, is the sly and calculating vice-president of the Host Club founded by his best friend and polar opposite, Tamaki Suoh. Despite Tamaki being president, Kyouya truly runs the club and plays the role of a puppet-master behind the scenes, earning him the nickname \"Shadow King.\" He takes care of the Host Club&#039;s expenses and will even sell items belonging to the host club members (such as Haruhi&#039;s pencil) for profit. In his words, \"use whatever is at hand, be it friend or foe.\" Almost everything he does is for his own benefit, but he can occasionally display a selfless side. He is the third son of his very wealthy and influential family; thus, if he wants to take over his family&#039;s business, he must work extremely hard to meet his strict father&#039;s high expectations. Also, Kyouya&#039;s bad temper when waking up in the morning has earned him the name \"Low-Blood Pressure Evil Lord.\"\n \n Despite being Tamaki&#039;s opposite, Kyouya has been known to support him in certain situations. One example being episode 8. Haruhi tried saving a bunch of girls from a group of molesters by throwing shells at them. One of them threw her over the edge of a small cliff. Tamaki rescued her, but later yelled at her for intervening and that girls shouldn&#039;t try to fight a group of boys. Haruhi countered that by saying that being a girl or boys doesn&#039;t matter in the real world. Later, she wandered into Kyouya&#039;s room in the villa they were staying at and Kyouya threw Haruhi on his bed and attempted to rape her. She told him that he wouldn&#039;t do it because he wouldn&#039;t gain anything. He backed off and Haruhi realized he did what he did to prove that she couldn&#039;t defend herself. His rape attempt was only to show that Tamaki was right and she won&#039;t always be able to win every fight. \n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n", "name": "Kyouya Ootori", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/90675.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/19240.jpg?s=8b4e16c145de8d076de1e7a522f73252", "link": "/manga/30/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33182.jpg?s=16a536c8097bc213d65d6909933da9c0", "link": "/manga/20777/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/39258.jpg?s=740f334574cfcccebe6ee3759e5262f2", "link": "/manga/24339/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_Short_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club Short Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/59387.jpg?s=a1eb51dff2dab27b13cb812a81763734", "link": "/manga/27029/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_University_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club University Special"}], "member-favorites": 2893, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/71992.jpg?s=721d5f3166e936ee69187e4bc004f319", "link": "/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}], "name-japanese": "(\u9cf3 \u93e1\u591c)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20553v.jpg", "link": "/people/42/Masaya_Matsukaze", "name": "Matsukaze, Masaya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48126v.jpg", "link": "/people/1602/John_Michael_Tatum", "name": "Tatum, John Michael", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/9255v.jpg", "link": "/people/10700/Felix_Spie\u00df", "name": "Spie\u00df, Felix", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15445v.jpg", "link": "/people/14853/Yong_Wu_Shin", "name": "Shin, Yong Wu", "language": "Korean"}]}
