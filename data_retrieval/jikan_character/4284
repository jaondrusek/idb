{"about": "Chrome is an artificial soldier who has part of Chalce's memories implanted by Chalce himself. He was first introduced to him when they were both kids, he couldn't talk and was hired by Chalce's father in order to teach Chalce swordplay. Later on Chalce taught him how to speak and in the end, defied his father when Chrome was supposed to be scrapped for learning what an artificial soldier shouldn't usually know.\n\n", "name": "Chrome ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/61527.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 7, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/15228.jpg?s=c5808b4a38b90deb57519584dad5fdbc", "link": "/anime/69/Cluster_Edge", "name": "Cluster Edge"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/4414.jpg?s=0b4127060d86e73123888482af5a2d97", "link": "/anime/3028/Cluster_Edge_Specials", "name": "Cluster Edge Specials"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30af\u30ed\u30e0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/41093v.jpg", "link": "/people/283/Hiroyuki_Yoshino", "name": "Yoshino, Hiroyuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15759v.jpg", "link": "/people/14819/Seung_jun_Kim", "name": "Kim, Seung jun", "language": "Korean"}]}
