{"about": "Shichika is the current head of the Kyotou-ryuu style. He was trained rigorously by his father, the previous head of the style. He is deeply dedicated to his training, and is strong enough to win against challengers without even using Kyotou-ryuu. Through the years, he has even developed new moves for the Kyotou-ryuu style.\n \n He cares deeply for his older sister Nanami, who has poor health, and often does her chores for her.\n \n He is in love with Togame, who trusts him because of this fact. Though he says he&#039;s in love with her, he has no idea how to deal with girls, as he shows no sign of arousal around Togame when she&#039;s naked, and doesn&#039;t even realize he&#039;s supposed to praise her when she wears new clothes. However, this allows Togame to be very open with him, which is an advantage to their quest of collecting the twelve deviant swords.\n \n He says that he is \"bad at thinking,\" but he could not be called naive as he is very aware of what is going on around him.\n \n According to Shikizaki Kiki, who possesses Maniwa Houou using Doukuto Mekki, Shichika&#039;s art of Kyouto-ryuu was the final and perfect Deviant Blade.\n\n", "name": "Shichika Yasuri", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/99233.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/167366.jpg?s=bcfdfc1b1bd97294870cadbb75697148", "link": "/manga/18161/Katanagatari", "name": "Katanagatari"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/199140.jpg?s=7aacd49c9a0ad28c811d6c9ff5b5b9ee", "link": "/manga/104170/Seishun_Kijinden_Nishio_Gakuen", "name": "Seishun Kijinden!
