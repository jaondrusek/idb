{"about": "A reserved girl with poor social skills, Azusa is a year below the Player and they attend the same school. Although she moved from the city 2 years ago, she has yet to become familiar with the town&#039;s atmosphere. She&#039;s always listening to her music player while walking by herself. Her favourite genres are the punk and rock, the ones that are a tad intense. She never misses out new releases. Her parents always work until late at night, which means she often goes out to eat. She especially loves junk food, which makes her a regular of Cafe Lakeside. She&#039;s bad at cooking, or more like, she can&#039;t cook at all.\n\n", "name": "Azusa Kurashiki", "image": "", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 4, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/82088.jpg?s=feea9210999eaa1009b3dde258471e43", "link": "/anime/33981/Pretty_x_Cation_2_The_Animation", "name": "Pretty x Cation 2 The Animation"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5009\u6577 \u6893)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/47385v.jpg", "link": "/people/43849/Mami_Yahiro", "name": "Yahiro, Mami", "language": "Japanese"}]}
