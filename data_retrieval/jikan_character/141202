{"about": "Angelo has a severe hatred for the Vanetti family, who killed his parents and younger brother. He hid himself away for seven years, but after receiving a certain letter, he appears in the Lawless district once more.\n \n After completing his revenge, and killing everyone except Nero the pair set off to for the ocean, Angelo as Nero&#039;s prisoner. One night on their road trip Angelo reveals that his revenge did not give him a reason to live again. Nero angered at the implication that his family&#039;s death was for nothing, demands to know why Angelo let him live. Angelo responds with the same question, referring to that night 7 years ago when Nero did not kill Angelo. Their relationship has culminated at this moment. Both having done equal harm to each other, are now left with an understanding of one another, and a question of what it means to continue to live without a purpose.  At the ocean, Angelo reveals he didn&#039;t kill Nero because he didn&#039;t want to. Angelo continues to walk along the beach as Nero points a gun at his back. Nero fires his gun, and we are transitioned to Nero driving. Nero notices a can of sliced pineapple on a passenger seat and smiles, most likely reminding him of his past journeys with Angelo. The credits rolls with the backdrop of the ocean and we are shown one last frame of footprints. The ending is left ambiguous. Nero may have killed Angelo or the scene could be implying that Angelo is alive and that Nero did not shoot him.\n \n (Source: ANN)\n\n", "name": "Angelo Lagusa", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/316406.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 1026, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/80515.jpg?s=64531ed013e64eaba196f22980cb06ad", "link": "/anime/32998/91_Days", "name": "91 Days"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/81707.jpg?s=e6025fa99e161972778a12b3e50604bf", "link": "/anime/33964/91_Days_Recap", "name": "91 Days Recap"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/87263.jpg?s=234676d839c05b8fc066f0797e978151", "link": "/anime/34777/91_Days_Special", "name": "91 Days Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/88885.jpg?s=7a27b70d053b493889d5184a001b0f36", "link": "/anime/36756/91_Daze", "name": "91 Daze"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30f4\u30a3\u30ea\u30aa\u30fb\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ce / \u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30ed\u30fb\u30e9\u30af\u30fc\u30b6)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48577v.jpg", "link": "/people/206/Takashi_Kondou", "name": "Kondou, Takashi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/47348v.jpg", "link": "/people/16641/Austin_Tindle", "name": "Tindle, Austin", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/43600v.jpg", "link": "/people/25773/Ayaka_Asai", "name": "Asai, Ayaka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48585v.jpg", "link": "/people/38451/Morgan_Berry", "name": "Berry, Morgan", "language": "English"}]}
