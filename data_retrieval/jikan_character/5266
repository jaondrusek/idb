{"about": "<b>Birthday:</b> August 8\n <b>Blood Type:</b> O\n <b>Height:</b> 165 cm (5&#039;5\")\n <b>Weight:</b> 52 kg\n \n Appearing as a puppet maker, Touko is actually an extremely powerful sorceress. \n \n Aozaki Touko appeared initially as the sister of Aozaki Aoko in the publicly unreleased novel Mahoutsukai no Yoru, and made a later appearance in Kara no Kyoukai. In the animated movies of Kara no Kyoukai, she is voiced by Honda Takako, while Inoue Kikuko lent her her voice for the drama CDs. \n \n In Kara no Kyoukai, she is shown as a puppet maker and occasionally as a designer of buildings. Together with Kokutou Mikiya, she runs a kind of detective agency (Garan no D\u014d (\u4f3d\u85cd\u306e\u6d1e, Garan no D\u014d?)) that only engages in cases with supernatural or abnormal elements. Touko does not share a particularly good relationship with her sister, yet the causes for this break are unknown.\n \n She&#039;s a powerful Magus, and she&#039;s able to reproduce parts of a body that can be used instead of the lost part. While this would be nothing special, she can reproduce the part in such a perfect way that it comes close to the real one. The glasses Tohno Shiki wears were originally made by Touko. Her sister Aoko stole them from Touko and made them indestructible.\n \n As a doll-maker, she received a Sealing Designation for creating a doll (body) that was an exact replica of her own body.\n \n Touko has 20 Magic Circuits, which was a surprise to the Aozaki clan as the number of Magic Circuits in their line had been dwindling. Due to her formidable power, Mage&#039;s Association dubbed her with the color Tou (\u6a59, Orange?), which is close to the three primary colors. She wished to get the color Blue, but that title was taken by her sister Aoko. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Touko Aozaki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/35111.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/45015.jpg?s=a0960628e5de1d30ce032ba7cff0b573", "link": "/manga/2062/Kara_no_Kyoukai__The_Garden_of_Sinners", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/67635.jpg?s=907a6c7b3e17185e5f7015258b474c6b", "link": "/manga/23947/Kara_no_Kyoukai__The_Garden_of_Sinners", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/63637.jpg?s=9c14b90ef5b9a56ef2a8d4814a8f3d33", "link": "/manga/26027/Mahoutsukai_no_Yoru", "name": "Mahoutsukai no Yoru"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/44057.jpg?s=7b5344e7b7aa46f59d2518f5f8d6bc57", "link": "/manga/27327/All_Around_Type-Moon", "name": "All Around Type-Moon"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/148209.jpg?s=c5550bb0d67b0b3f984c7815aaa1ef77", "link": "/manga/85437/Lord_El-Melloi_II-sei_no_Jikenbo", "name": "Lord El-Melloi II-sei no Jikenbo"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/155052.jpg?s=50f23fb3c9b3dc3cafd9012694a292dc", "link": "/manga/87581/Type-Moon_Gakuen__Chibichuki", "name": "Type-Moon Gakuen: Chibichuki!"}], "member-favorites": 681, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/21741.jpg?s=9c1e07c1d3058a738bb5fcc917beeeb1", "link": "/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1__Fukan_Fuukei", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/21737.jpg?s=dd2f17aac5f47e841a8e849ef7b4ac29", "link": "/anime/3782/Kara_no_Kyoukai_2__Satsujin_Kousatsu_Zen", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 2: Satsujin Kousatsu (Zen)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/21735.jpg?s=c420925b43a2c068473b73e7687094b6", "link": "/anime/3783/Kara_no_Kyoukai_3__Tsuukaku_Zanryuu", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 3: Tsuukaku Zanryuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/21736.jpg?s=eb61a49a4fcc9d71b5333c3d9f862515", "link": "/anime/4280/Kara_no_Kyoukai_4__Garan_no_Dou", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 4: Garan no Dou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/9246.jpg?s=385e624d064bee7dc7508b02046a809d", "link": "/anime/4282/Kara_no_Kyoukai_5__Mujun_Rasen", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/21739.jpg?s=6f8aef359bf1494fee494fba8224192c", "link": "/anime/5204/Kara_no_Kyoukai_6__Boukyaku_Rokuon", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 6: Boukyaku Rokuon"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/56619.jpg?s=de793a44ddb5a4caa7a8bda446fbd304", "link": "/anime/5205/Kara_no_Kyoukai_7__Satsujin_Kousatsu_Kou", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Kou)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/15175.jpg?s=fdf8731acd30655784d1b6f2361f6124", "link": "/anime/6624/Kara_no_Kyoukai_Remix__Gate_of_Seventh_Heaven", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai Remix: Gate of Seventh Heaven"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/56621.jpg?s=bf4786050d6c264bbffdd2b957b51e42", "link": "/anime/14807/Kara_no_Kyoukai__Mirai_Fukuin", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/73930.jpg?s=b0b24074770f1121badbde700c12d112", "link": "/anime/22763/Kara_no_Kyoukai__Mirai_Fukuin_-_Extra_Chorus", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin - Extra Chorus"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/59323.jpg?s=205007890ebb55693bef44ad80dc79b6", "link": "/anime/22847/Kara_no_Kyoukai__Mirai_Fukuin_-_Manner_Movie", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin - Manner Movie"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/78704.jpg?s=7cd256f21247b3e33fa139ea0d760678", "link": "/anime/23697/Kara_no_Kyoukai__Manner_Movies", "name": "Kara no Kyoukai: Manner Movies"}], "name-japanese": "(\u84bc\u5d0e \u6a59\u5b50)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49689v.jpg", "link": "/people/41/Takako_Honda", "name": "Honda, Takako", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/5221v.jpg", "link": "/people/1668/Christin_Marquitan", "name": "Marquitan, Christin", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/28761v.jpg", "link": "/people/26653/B\u00e9rang\u00e8re_Jean", "name": "Jean, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re", "language": "French"}]}
