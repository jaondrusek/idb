{"about": "Age: About 10 or 11 Mentally at least 110\n Birthday: August 21 (Leo)\n Height: 137 cm\n \n Rika is one of the main characters in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. She is a younger classmate in Keiichi&#039;s school, and is in the same grade level as Satoko. Naturally, she is great friends with her, as they live together in the same house. She is revered by the villagers as the heir of the local shrine, and plays the role of a miko in the annual Watanagashi Festival. She has been the head of the Furude house since her parents died, but rarely attends town meetings due to her young age. While she does not speak a lot, she likes to say nonsense words such as \"mi~\" and \"nipa~\" and often ends her sentences with \"-nano desu,\" which inflame Rena&#039;s passion for cute things. She also likes to describe events using sound effects, such as \"The cat was going &#039;nya nya&#039; and &#039;scritch scritch&#039;\" or saying \"Clap! Clap! Clap!\" when clapping her hands. Despite her young appearance, she seems to be quite fond of wine, as well as kimchi. The wine she drinks is hinted to be Bernkastel vintage.\n \n It is later revealed that Rika is the \"Queen Carrier\" of the lethal Hinamizawa Syndrome, and in turn keeps the virus under control and prevents it from spreading. Any that leave her presence will exhibit symptoms of the disease, which explains why anyone who leaves Hinamizawa is immediately stricken. According to the late Doctor Takano&#039;s research, in the event of Rika&#039;s death, within days the entire village of Hinamizawa will fall victim to the disease, and it is also said to spread to neighboring villages if this occurs. For this reason, Rika is sought out and mysteriously murdered in each arc.\n \n She has lived for hundreds of years and she&#039;s the only one (together with Hanyuu) who is aware of the time loop, although her friends eventually become aware of their deeds in previous worlds.\n\n", "name": "Rika Furude", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/320768.jpg", "mangaography":
