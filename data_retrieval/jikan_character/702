{"about": "Born: March 5, 1981\n Height: 162 cm (5&#039;4\")\n Weight: 43 kg (95 lbs.)\n Family: Misuzu Osaki (mother)\n Miyuki Osaki (grandmother, also foster mother&mdash;deceased)\n Misato Uehara (half-sister)\n \n One of the titular characters of the series, Osaki Nana may look like a tough punk rocker, but she has a kind heart and is a devoted friend. Abandoned by her parents and raised by her grandmother, Nana was expelled from high school after she was falsely accused of prostitution. Despite these hardships, Nana \"polishes the shards of her dreams\" and is determined to be successful as the lead vocalist of Blast. She is now engaged to her first love, Ren, although she also has lingering, ambiguous feelings for Yasu. Nana&#039;s favourite things never change. Her favorite designer is Vivienne Westwood, and her favorite band is the Sex Pistols. She smokes Seven Stars and likes coffee with milk and strawberry cake.  She also has the ability to cook, but prepares all her food with too much salt which only Ren seems to enjoy.\n \n In recent chapters, Nana had started getting panic attacks due to stressful situations, causing her to have trouble breathing. This usually had to be remedied by putting a bag over her mouth to circulate carbon dioxide and regulate her breathing. Hachi wasn&#039;t aware of this problem until Chapter 81, where she helped Nana&#039;s breathing giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, providing her carbon dioxide.\n (Source: Wikipedia, Nana wikia)\n\n", "name": "Nana Osaki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/28355.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/163191.jpg?s=1b4710b799f4d19f3530d0e05c4e3087", "link": "/manga/28/Nana", "name": "Nana"}], "member-favorites": 5292, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/11232.jpg?s=756a35e292f249137df1e21cd4c2072d", "link": "/anime/877/Nana", "name": "Nana"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5927\u5d0e \u30ca\u30ca)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/33763v.jpg", "link": "/people/82/Romi_Park", "name": "Park, Romi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/9778v.jpg", "link": "/people/5376/Anna_Tsuchiya", "name": "Tsuchiya, Anna", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42504v.jpg", "link": "/people/6833/Rebecca_Shoichet", "name": "Shoichet, Rebecca", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20087v.jpg", "link": "/people/8373/Anna_Peller", "name": "Peller, Anna", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/46529v.jpg", "link": "/people/9251/Selvaggia_Quattrini", "name": "Quattrini, Selvaggia", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49254v.jpg", "link": "/people/13963/Graciela_Molina", "name": "Molina, Graciela", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15621v.jpg", "link": "/people/14921/Seon_Yeong_Park", "name": "Park, Seon Yeong", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/30817v.jpg", "link": "/people/29627/Claudine_Gr\u00e9my", "name": "Gr\u00e9my, Claudine", "language": "French"}]}
