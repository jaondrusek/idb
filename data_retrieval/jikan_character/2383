{"about": "Birthday: September 4\n Height: 140cm\n Weight: 31kg\n Blood Type: O\n Three Sizes: 68/51/72\n \n Jun'ichi's cousin and first love. She is a very lively girl who shows great affection toward Junichi, much to Nemu's dismay. She is sometimes seen with Utamaru, a white cat. Sakura is actually older than Junichi. She inherited her grandmother's magical ability, and despite the passing of several years, her appearance remains largely unchanged from what Jun'ichi and Nemu remember. She has an IQ of 180.\n \n As of D.C. II:\n She is currently the principal of the Kazami Academy and maintains her youthful appearance, despite the story of D.C. II occurring 53 years after the events of the Original Da Capo.\n Her appearance remains unchanged after a lot of time skips because the Sakura tree causes her to age extremely slowly. In D.C. II, she merges with the Sakura tree in an attempt to control it, but fails. In the D.C. II anime finale, she disappears along with the withered sakura tree to bring Yoshiyuki back. In the D.C. II visual novel epilogue, we discover that she doesn't disappear from the earth; instead, she is seen wandering across the earth for the rest of her days, and she has lost her memories.\n\n", "name": "Sakura Yoshino", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/165541.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/31756.jpg?s=bff4a68612e018a6d87727e2ca89ef38", "link": "/manga/3052/Da_Capo", "name": "Da Capo"}], "member-favorites": 89, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/73936.jpg?s=7d48408a9018afa98843ba9c93270597", "link": "/anime/62/DC__Da_Capo", "name": "D.C.: Da Capo"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/73937.jpg?s=b7703eb5a1d6eeeb31aab48382a29e81", "link": "/anime/291/DCSS__Da_Capo_Second_Season", "name": "D.C.S.S: Da Capo Second Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75305.jpg?s=cf7322aca6938e6fa53b32096ec9c707", "link": "/anime/2595/DCII__Da_Capo_II", "name": "D.C.II: Da Capo II"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/75306.jpg?s=607ab42cee6501dc163a0ff1bf42837d", "link": "/anime/3627/DCII_SS__Da_Capo_II_Second_Season", "name": "D.C.II S.S.: Da Capo II Second Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/25445.jpg?s=fd457807908834baa12839d3318dc4de", "link": "/anime/5216/DCif__Da_Capo_if", "name": "D.C.if: Da Capo if"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/36771.jpg?s=e9e33ce1a1083f4d5bed5642197a902c", "link": "/anime/9393/TP_Sakura__Time_Paladin_Sakura", "name": "T.P.
