{"about": "Aries Mu (\u7261\u7f8a\u5ea7\u306e\u30e0\u30a6, Ariesu no M\u016b?)\n Age: 20  \n Gender: Male  \n Date of birth: March 27  \n Nationality: Tibet  \n Class: Saint  \n Loyalty: Athena  \n Cloth: Aries  \n Rank: Gold  \n Training: Jamir  \n Height: 1.82 m  \n Weight: 75 kg  \n Blood type: A  \n Secret moves: Glamour Illusion, Crystal Wall, Crystal Net, Starlight Extinction, Stardust Revolution  \n First appearance:\n Manga: Chapter 12, vol.3\n Anime: ep.10\n Is a fictional character from the manga Saint Seiya, authored by japanese mangaka Masami Kurumada, and later adapted to anime. He is one of the bronze saint&#039;s most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\n \n Mu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\n \n Under the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n \n Mu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as &#039;Lord Mu&#039; or &#039;Mister Mu&#039;. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n \n Before the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn&#039;t until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n \n Throughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person&#039;s total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Muu Aries", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/291228.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/155914.jpg?s=0998cefcd21b89fa39f9810826c811fc", "link": "/manga/1045/Saint_Seiya", "name": "Saint Seiya"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/163118.jpg?s=24e9207fd87d975435ca87bdc6b190f7", "link": "/manga/1046/Saint_Seiya_Episode_G", "name": "Saint Seiya Episode G"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/154143.jpg?s=d023ef410574c1de0496da41e7379fcd", "link": "/manga/54761/Saint_Seiya__Saintia_Shou", "name": "Saint Seiya: Saintia Shou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/187408.jpg?s=6b3cb9b837deaa9731b28c1f4e99c302", "link": "/manga/67297/Saint_Seiya_Episode_G__Assassin", "name": "Saint Seiya Episode G: Assassin"}], "member-favorites": 95, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/75732.jpg?s=a46a7857d98aa9b6e068b22ee2bae847", "link": "/anime/1253/Saint_Seiya__Meiou_Hades_Meikai-hen", "name": "Saint Seiya: Meiou Hades Meikai-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/28496.jpg?s=682f15281bc191e9f9d41451434e2cf1", "link": "/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya", "name": "Saint Seiya"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/16343.jpg?s=84d5c553bf9d9e9831c7c60a0e7fa665", "link": "/anime/1257/Saint_Seiya__Meiou_Hades_Juuni_Kyuu-hen", "name": "Saint Seiya: Meiou Hades Juuni Kyuu-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/16347.jpg?s=9f5e36f72416ec80fdca278811218547", "link": "/anime/1260/Saint_Seiya__Saishuu_Seisen_no_Senshi-tachi", "name": "Saint Seiya: Saishuu Seisen no Senshi-tachi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/13518.jpg?s=90270659b829c187416dca87630f72e2", "link": "/anime/6154/Saint_Seiya__The_Hades_Chapter_Sanctuary_-_Yomigaerishi_Gold_Saint-tachi_no_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter Sanctuary -
