Seiei is the main protagonist of the story in Gundam 00. He&#039;s a Gundam Meister of Celestial Being. In season 1, he pilots GN-001 Gundam Exia and later to GN-0000 00 Gundam in season 2. In the movie, he pilots 00 Qan[T]~-start-25-stop \n His name could also be denoted to state his personality. Translated it could mean To obtain the moment.\n \n Setsuna is taciturn, introverted, and righteous against war. He believes there are key disturbances that affect the world from coming together in peace and harmony. He labeled specific people and/or forces as a source of conflict towards the world&#039;s path to peace. He has little tolerance for diplomats and politicians, believing that their negotiations only prolong wars and cause more strife (due to personal experience). He&#039;s got a vendetta to settle and his past battle experiences stirs old bitter feelings, increasing his combat potential as a beneficial side effect. Though a self proclaimed atheist, he often questions the motivations of God with people and worldly events. He idolizes the Gundams so much that he wants to embody Exia as himself, a Gundam. He&#039;s a traditionalist in honor and a martyr for his cause in Celestial Being. \n \n In a letter to Marina Ismail, he revealed more in depth into his feelings and thinking. Setsuna wanted to understand the lesser aspects of humanity. He wanted to know why the world is filled with people with innate dark intentions and inconsiderate of other people&#039;s suffering. He wanted to find these answers with his Gundam in hopes to bring mutual understanding and peace.\n \n After a 5 year hiatus, Setsuna has taken an unofficial role as the leader of the Gundam Meisters. He&#039;s now able to assert and express his feelings to people without reservation. Setsuna&#039;s ideals are still the same, but his recent experiences lead him to believe the importance of self change and the need to fight for a better future. His determination and strong self confidence motivates and inspires people around him. He&#039;s more understanding and compromising, but also capable making hard-but necessary-decisions that would lead people to dislike him. He has no problems making life defining decisions for other people when they can&#039;t make the choice and would kill if necessary. \n \n Setsuna is skilled in many ways of war. Trained by Ali Al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As Celestial Being&#039;s Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia&#039;s combat style. He&#039;s been trained by Celestial Being to know limited MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam. His 5 year hiatus with Celestial Being didn&#039;t dull his piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed improvement.\n \n Due to the power of 00 Gundam&#039;s concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Riser, Setsuna&#039;s brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He&#039;s able to sense quantum brainwaves near him and hone in. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity&#039;s first true/genuine Innovator. \n \n Setsuna&#039;s Innovator capabilities aren&#039;t completely defined as he&#039;s the first naturally evolved Innovator. It has yet to be proven can he communicate with Veda or Celestial Being technology like Innovades can; he can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and sense impending danger from far distances. Until there is greater clarity, much of his Innovator capabilities is based on observation and speculation. \n \n Skills & Capabilities\n Setsuna is skilled in many ways of war and fighting. Trained by Ali al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As CB&#039;s Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia&#039;s combat style. He&#039;s been trained by CB to know some MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam.\n His 4 year hiatus (AD 2312 - Season 2) with Celestial Being didn&#039;t dull his MS piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed great improvement. Due to the power of 00 Gundam&#039;s concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Raiser, Setsuna&#039;s brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He&#039;s able to sense quantum brainwaves (QBWs) near him and track users of QBWs. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity&#039;s first true/genuine Innovator.\n \n Setsuna&#039;s Innovator capabilities aren&#039;t completely defined as he&#039;s the first naturally evolved Innovator. It has yet to be revealed if he can communicate with Veda or Celestial Being technology like the Innovades can. He can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and sense impending danger from far distances. As an Innovator, he has heightened reflexes, a longer lifespan than normal humans, and can communicate his thoughts via quantum brainwaves.\n \n After Setsuna joined the ELS, his body is not entirely human. The ELS reformed his body based on their bio-technology, forever retaining his youthful appearance with a metallic shine. It can be inferred that Setsuna became a hybrid of a Innovator and a ELS.\n\n", "name": "Setsuna F.
