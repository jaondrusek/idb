{"about": "A former friend and rival of Kamogawa and Nekota. In his younger days, Hama boxed along with the two, but never managed to reach their level, partially due to his unusually fragile jaw. Nevertheless, he is a brilliant tactician who, since having left Japan for Mexico, is renowned for his successful training of several champions, including Sanada Kazuki. Hama still harbors deep feelings of rivalry towards Kamogawa, and strives to one day train a boxer that can defeat Makunouchi or Takamura. He is currently the trainer of Alexander Volg Zangief in America.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Dankichi Hama", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/204747.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/15282.jpg?s=122c3a4f2a2151db55b2c489ff66c9e1", "link": "/manga/7/Hajime_no_Ippo", "name": "Hajime no Ippo"}], "member-favorites": 2, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/2361.jpg?s=09878abd9c43297e186f48b28535598a", "link": "/anime/264/Hajime_no_Ippo__Champion_Road", "name": "Hajime no Ippo: Champion Road"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/56147.jpg?s=e94905007e8f2df9df634c49107a78f2", "link": "/anime/19647/Hajime_no_Ippo__Rising", "name": "Hajime no Ippo: Rising"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6d5c \u56e3\u5409)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42158v.jpg", "link": "/people/25/Hiroki_Yasumoto", "name": "Yasumoto, Hiroki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/1088v.jpg", "link": "/people/1036/Seizou_Katou", "name": "Katou, Seizou", "language": "Japanese"}]}
