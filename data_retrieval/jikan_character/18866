{"about": "Age: Over 300\n Birthday: April 24\n Height: 162 cm\n BWH: 80-56-83\n \n Haqua du Lot Herminium (\u30cf\u30af\u30a2\u30fb\u30c9\u30fb\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d8\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0, Hakua Do Rotto Heruminiumu) is the tritagonist in the The World God Only Knows series. She is the role model and best friend of Elsie, though in the beginning, she refuses the fact that she and Elsie are friends. She is the District Chief of Area 32 in Nagumo City. As the valedictorian of her entire grade level, she was considered as one of the most intelligent students, although it has been shown that she is not among the best members of the Runaway Spirit Squad\n \n Haqua is shown to be very harsh on herself. She is aggressive, but has a soft spot for close friends, such as Elsie. She grew up as independent person and is reluctant to accept help from others. She also goes to great lengths to conceal faults in order to maintain her reputation.\n \n For example, in the beginning she lied to Elsie about capturing 10 spirits even though she had yet to capture any.\n \n Nora has also stated more than one time that Haqua is too honest and trusts others too easily.\n \n Haqua&#039;s abilities in capturing spirits are not very good for being a District Chief. In her first appearance, she met Keima and Elsie while trying to capture a loose soul that she had previously failed to capture. After being assigned a buddy, Haqua was able to capture 4 spirits within a week because of her partner&#039;s method of capturing.\n \n She has a very unique battle style, with her body movement and the usage of her scythe. Haqua can use more spells than Elsie, as shown by her ability to burn her enemies or anyone she dislikes.\n \n She is shown to be very book-smart. Haqua has even shown to be able to make her scythe emit azure flames. This power seems to stem from the scythe itself as even after Haqua got fired, she is still able to use this skill. Her power over her scythe is skillful enough that she is able to control the flames to be used as a mid-range projectile. The flames are also hot enough to melt and destroy a Vintage communicator in seconds.\n \n In terms of her hagoromo skills, Haqua -like Elsie- is able to fly, create dolls and change the appearances of objects. Haqua can also do video playbacks of the past, averaging at most a few days to gather any information when needed. This skill is apparently unique only to her.\n \n Haqua is also skillful with spells she learned during her school days as even after being fired from the Runaway Spirit Squad and no longer having the hagoromo, Haqua is still able to fly at high velocity by managing 20 different types of spells at the same time.\n \n (Source: Kaminomi Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Haqua du Lot Herminium", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/116928.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/188974.jpg?s=dd8e841a460ce9df53dcb629662d766d", "link": "/manga/7519/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai", "name": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/160833.jpg?s=be14344fe6099824aa8c1cfc683a799d", "link": "/manga/79883/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai__On_the_Train_Pilot_Films", "name": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai: On the Train+Pilot Films"}], "member-favorites": 842, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/30030.jpg?s=5ea8ee6d031ecf8f8614d52916185639", "link": "/anime/10080/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai_II", "name": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai II"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/32091.jpg?s=35af7af983cf1fae456c1f70310653ca", "link": "/anime/11507/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai__Nonstop_Hunters", "name": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai: Nonstop!!
