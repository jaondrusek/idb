{"about": "Yuki is the rat of the zodiac. Known as \"The Prince\" or \"Prince Yuki\"  at school, Yuki is very pretty and refined, and has many admirers at school, but has a hard time being social. He wishes that he could be with people as friends, rather than admired and worshiped from afar. Yuki has suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of Akito, the head of the Sohma clan, who locked up and mentally tortured him. Because of this, Yuki has a somewhat low sense of worth and is claustrophobic. With Tooru's help, however, Yuki is gradually able to loosen up. He is jealous of Kyo because he thinks Kyo can have a normal life, which Yuki always wanted.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Yuki Souma", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/47921.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/26105.jpg?s=c6cc78baa85af96f893aacbcd4e55534", "link": "/manga/102/Fruits_Basket", "name": "Fruits Basket"}], "member-favorites": 1120, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/75204.jpg?s=092a62a554763a400696018b17931a35", "link": "/anime/120/Fruits_Basket", "name": "Fruits Basket"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8349\u6469 \u7531\u5e0c)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/30717v.jpg", "link": "/people/80/Aya_Hisakawa", "name": "Hisakawa, Aya", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12481v.jpg", "link": "/people/312/Eric_Vale", "name": "Vale, Eric", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/33041v.jpg", "link": "/people/10733/Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric_Popovic", "name": "Popovic, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15759v.jpg", "link": "/people/14819/Seung_jun_Kim", "name": "Kim, Seung jun", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/21353v.jpg", "link": "/people/18975/Albert_Trifol_Segarra", "name": "Trifol Segarra, Albert", "language": "Spanish"}]}
