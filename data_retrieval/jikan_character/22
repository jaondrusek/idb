{"about": "Name: Hikaru Hitachiin\n Birthday: June 9 (elder brother)\n Age: 16\n Sign: Gemini\n Height: 175 cm (5&#039;9\")\n Blood Type: B\n Grade: First Year, Class A\n Status: Wealthy Lineage\n Host Type: \"Little Devil\"\n Favorite Subjects: Math, Physics, Chemistry\n Favorite Foods: Italian, anything super spicy, maple syrup\n Rose Color: blue\n \n Hikaru Hitachiin is a devious and childish first-year student who greatly enjoys toying with his fellow Host Club members Haruhi and Tamaki (whom he often calls, \"My Lord\"). He and his younger identical twin, Kaoru, are \"little devil\" type hosts who put on an act of \"forbidden brotherly love\" (with Hikaru as the seme) to draw in their clients. Unlike Tamaki, the Hitachiin brothers are wholly calculating in their customer relations; however, this is because of their deep dependency of each other, and a reluctance to let anyone into their world. They share a deep emotional bond, which was forged through a lonely childhood and the painful fact that no one could ever tell them apart without looking at the parting of their hair (Hikaru&#039;s hair parts to the right; Kaoru&#039;s parts to the left). Since Haruhi is the first person that can truthfully tell them apart, they greatly treasure her friendship. Haruhi has stated that Hikaru and Kaoru have their differences, despite being identical twins. Of the two, Hikaru is a little more in-control of their twincest acts, but is also more childish and immature than Kaoru, though he is the older twin.\n \n Tamaki was the one who coerced the brothers into joining the Host Club in their last year of middle school. Since they told him they would join if he could guess which one was Hikaru, Tamaki repeatedly followed them around, tossing out random guesses as to who was Hikaru and who was Kaoru. They finally crumbled, and decided to join, which was their first step towards a greater exposure to a world outside of their own. Later in the manga, both Hikaru and Kaoru fall in love with Haruhi; although she has already rejected him once, Hikaru is determined to not lose to Tamaki. Eventually, however, Hikaru accepts that Haruhi loves Tamaki, and instead encourages her to confess to him, saying he is over her and wants her and Tamaki to get together (although he always looks pained as he says this).\n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n", "name": "Hikaru Hitachiin", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/48468.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/19240.jpg?s=8b4e16c145de8d076de1e7a522f73252", "link": "/manga/30/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33182.jpg?s=16a536c8097bc213d65d6909933da9c0", "link": "/manga/20777/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/39258.jpg?s=740f334574cfcccebe6ee3759e5262f2", "link": "/manga/24339/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_Short_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club Short Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/59387.jpg?s=a1eb51dff2dab27b13cb812a81763734", "link": "/manga/27029/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_University_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club University Special"}], "member-favorites": 4229, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/71992.jpg?s=721d5f3166e936ee69187e4bc004f319", "link": "/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5e38\u9678\u9662\u5149)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42208v.jpg", "link": "/people/5/Kenichi_Suzumura", "name": "Suzumura, Kenichi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39033v.jpg", "link": "/people/860/Todd_Haberkorn", "name": "Haberkorn, Todd", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/33223v.jpg", "link": "/people/6124/Nico_Sablik", "name": "Sablik, Nico", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15323v.jpg", "link": "/people/14777/Sang_Hyeon_Eom", "name": "Eom, Sang Hyeon", "language": "Korean"}]}
