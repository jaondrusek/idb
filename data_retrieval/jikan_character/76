{"about": "Kuroyanagi's understudy, a serious bread artisan. A master of the katana who claims to have left the swordsman path of destruction to follow the path of life-giving bread. Despite that, he often becomes very warrior-like and fearsome during baking competitions, which occasionally makes other characters wonder if he is truly focused on the \"life-giving\" aspect of his bread. Like Kawachi, he has solar gauntlets and considers Azuma as a rival. On first appearances, he seems cold-hearted and tough, but in the Monaco Cup Final, he falls in love with a rival German baker working for the American team, Monica Adenauer, and shows a more tender side of himself. He has an unexplained fear of heights as shown in the parachuting into the Mexico arena.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Kai Suwabara", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/33042.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/28467.jpg?s=aadb146f9087d5ff202de2fb44d644a7", "link": "/manga/653/Yakitate_Japan", "name": "Yakitate!!
