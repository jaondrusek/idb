{"about": "Birthday: June 3rd\n Height: 153 cm (5&#039; 0\")\n BWH: 85/59/84\n Rank: High-class Devil\n Role: Bishop\n Race: Pure-Blooded Devil\n \n Raiser&#039;s sister. Ravel is shown to be very loyal to her older brother, as she is seen diligently obeying his authority. She strongly believes that her brother is so powerful, no one could ever possibly defeat him. She is also Raiser&#039;s Bishop.\n \n She follows her brother&#039;s authority to a full degree, as she sees that there is no one who can defeat him. Just like her brother, Ravel is also a Phoenix. After seeing her brother&#039;s defeat at the hands of Issei, she becomes infatuated with him, and later transfers to his school so she can spend more time with him. Later on as the story continues, she falls in love with him completely, and does not mind becoming his concubine so long as she can be with him. She is currently a \"free\" Bishop since she traded herself back to her mother&#039;s team (who does not participate in Rating Games). It is likely she will trade herself to become one of Issei&#039;s Bishops when he gains peerage, as she wants to be of use to Issei. She moves into the Hyodo residence in Volume 10.\n\n", "name": "Ravel Phenex", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/242055.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/175003.jpg?s=1d00023273bb401914a136ed3d74bbff", "link": "/manga/25409/High_School_DxD", "name": "High School DxD"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/57421.jpg?s=7bd094ee19566065553e1f7d5b3ac382", "link": "/manga/30859/High_School_DxD", "name": "High School DxD"}], "member-favorites": 108, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/32527.jpg?s=35963a1ceb787b4f8335ebce64b0a7f4", "link": "/anime/11617/High_School_DxD", "name": "High School DxD"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/73642.jpg?s=fbef954c36de8290b6bf696bcf1a1358", "link": "/anime/24703/High_School_DxD_BorN", "name": "High School DxD BorN"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/77358.jpg?s=9e5a100d3549c4f2ea04a57d9bca0d67", "link": "/anime/32215/High_School_DxD_BorN__Yomigaeranai_Fushichou", "name": "High School DxD BorN: Yomigaeranai Fushichou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ec\u30a4\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/34809v.jpg", "link": "/people/414/Brittney_Karbowski", "name": "Karbowski, Brittney", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28127v.jpg", "link": "/people/10707/Asuka_Nishi", "name": "Nishi, Asuka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/32505v.jpg", "link": "/people/31353/Sarah_Alles", "name": "Alles, Sarah", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/45960v.jpg", "link": "/people/42606/Alice_Bauer", "name": "Bauer, Alice", "language": "German"}]}
