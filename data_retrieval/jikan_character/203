{"about": "Birthday: July 26\n \n Mikoto is a close friend of Tenma. She is tall, well-developed, and tomboyish. She has a black belt in Kenpo, and is often seen sparring with her childhood friend Haruki. She had a crush on a senpai of hers, but she gave up on him after discovering he had already met someone. Mikoto was dating her classmate Asou until recently, but for some reason yet unexplained, he broke up with her.\n\n", "name": "Mikoto Suou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/66180.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/5267.jpg?s=b6db00c6eaf26739a5ba7f221c8d461b", "link": "/manga/160/School_Rumble", "name": "School Rumble"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/22036.jpg?s=47094f360a67f6725a88eb571d3703a5", "link": "/manga/9259/School_Rumble_Z", "name": "School Rumble Z"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/29068.jpg?s=e6f7196d3d91f8b4bc37ad08b2f7c638", "link": "/manga/18982/Bessatsu_School_Rumble", "name": "Bessatsu School Rumble"}], "member-favorites": 65, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/75488.jpg?s=6a1a9ddcb77f542e5d49c67a27848887", "link": "/anime/24/School_Rumble", "name": "School Rumble"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75489.jpg?s=e9db10e10b6fc2e1211aa7d114e1787a", "link": "/anime/517/School_Rumble_Ichi_Gakki_Hoshuu", "name": "School Rumble Ichi Gakki Hoshuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75490.jpg?s=393b8918e48d90d7f37e2523b0820b41", "link": "/anime/846/School_Rumble_Ni_Gakki", "name": "School Rumble Ni Gakki"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/9553.jpg?s=d3e7b6b9780d5e794bd5400b761c9fac", "link": "/anime/4015/School_Rumble_San_Gakki", "name": "School Rumble San Gakki"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5468\u9632 \u7f8e\u7434)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44250v.jpg", "link": "/people/184/Hitomi_Nabatame", "name": "Nabatame, Hitomi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/48137v.jpg", "link": "/people/659/Brina_Palencia", "name": "Palencia, Brina", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/4629v.jpg", "link": "/people/7534/Giovanna_Papandrea", "name": "Papandrea, Giovanna", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15409v.jpg", "link": "/people/14837/Myeong_Seon_Lee", "name": "Lee, Myeong Seon", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46550v.jpg", "link": "/people/23737/Tanja_Dohse", "name": "Dohse, Tanja", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/27527/Julie_Deliquet", "name": "Deliquet, Julie", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/31385v.jpg", "link": "/people/30747/Seon_Lee", "name": "Lee, Seon", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49624v.jpg", "link": "/people/46151/Ana_Mar\u00eda_Camps", "name": "Camps, Ana Mar\u00eda", "language": "Spanish"}]}
