{"about": "Heine is the royal tutor chosen by the king to groom the four princes ready for the throne in case something happens to the oldest son.\n \n Heine used to take care of orphans underground where they lived and tought them how to survive. He has known the king since he was a prince, and used to sneak out of the palace just to meet up with Heine. One day the guards noticed that the prince was missing and looked everywhere to find him until they spotted the prince with Heine. They tried to run away but while doing so Heine dropped a pocket watch which the prince gave to him. A guard aimed a gun at Heine presuming that he abducted the prince and tried to hold him hostage for money. The prince saw the guard aiming for Heine and protected him by going in between them which led to the prince getting shot.The guard then shouted that Heine used the prince as a shield. Heine was shocked to see this and started attacking the guards out of rage but the prince told him to stop which Heine obeyed and let himself get arrested and put in jail. He then would pray everyday for the prince to get better until the prince explained everything to the king and eventually let Heine out of jail. Hen then started to teach the kids how to read and write at a church which the prince built after becoming king.\n\n", "name": "Heine Wittgenstein", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/319056.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/130353.jpg?s=8a53ee3672af66de9503999962d7f353", "link": "/manga/75243/Oushitsu_Kyoushi_Heine", "name": "Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine"}], "member-favorites": 219, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/85517.jpg?s=f445c6810b4a4fefa59be50a1a69c5be", "link": "/anime/34262/Oushitsu_Kyoushi_Heine", "name": "Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23753v.jpg", "link": "/people/8686/Micah_Solusod", "name": "Solusod, Micah", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/47262v.jpg", "link": "/people/43577/Keisuke_Ueda", "name": "Ueda, Keisuke", "language": "Japanese"}]}
