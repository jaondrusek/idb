{"about": "Kuranosuke is the son of a rich political family. He uses the alias \"Kurako\" in front of the other Amars to hide his gender. He enjoys cross-dressing, to the chagrin of his family. \n \n Unlike the rest of his family, he does not find politics interesting at all and desires to get into fashion. He is constantly looking for the address of his mother, who gave birth to him after having an affair with his father, hoping to see at least once more the wardrobe she kept with so much passion. \n \n After meeting Tsukimi, helping her rescue Clara, he constantly starts paying her visits, finding her more interesting than anything else in his life. Throughout his life he has always been popular with pretty girls and thus, he almost cannot believe it when he starts realizing he may have feelings for Tsukimi.\n\n", "name": "Kuranosuke Koibuchi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/101904.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/149209.jpg?s=fcf40b640527093bac0bae002bc4c60a", "link": "/manga/17904/Kuragehime", "name": "Kuragehime"}], "member-favorites": 1269, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/24865.jpg?s=6151d82a1e5296987b54b8e263b6829e", "link": "/anime/8129/Kuragehime", "name": "Kuragehime"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/27015.jpg?s=83550fa1b5ddc0707d27963501e3d0b2", "link": "/anime/9754/Kuragehime__Eiyuu_Retsuden\u2606", "name": "Kuragehime: Eiyuu Retsuden\u2606"}], "name-japanese": "(\u9bc9\u6df5\u8535\u4e4b\u4ecb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/9931v.jpg", "link": "/people/197/Mitsuki_Saiga", "name": "Saiga, Mitsuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/29709v.jpg", "link": "/people/1047/Josh_Grelle", "name": "Grelle, Josh", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/30851v.jpg", "link": "/people/9091/Alexis_Tipton", "name": "Tipton, Alexis", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15447v.jpg", "link": "/people/14855/Ju_Chang_Lee", "name": "Lee, Ju Chang", "language": "Korean"}]}
