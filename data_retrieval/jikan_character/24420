{"about": "Kyouko is the manager of Wagnaria. She usually maintains a rather apathetic attitude about how the restaurant is run and almost never bothers to do any work herself. She is not beyond using violence to deal with unruly customers and firmly believes that employees come before the customers, as the employees are the ones doing all the work. She is 28 years old, but she becomes despondent whenever her age is mentioned. Kyouko saved Yachiyo as a little girl from bullies, which is how they met.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Kyouko Shirafuji", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/135721.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/3306.jpg?s=92f8946ad038cdb5c578039ee8c087d8", "link": "/manga/3044/Working", "name": "Working!!"}], "member-favorites": 34, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/75262.jpg?s=855dab8aa122f8c180f9d6ecf5f63f8f", "link": "/anime/6956/Working", "name": "Working!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/75263.jpg?s=5976a4419f057ae1a68dd9b85813a04a", "link": "/anime/10521/Working", "name": "Working'!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/73886.jpg?s=2d8f16c3cacb9d793dbde65b211520cd", "link": "/anime/25879/Working", "name": "Working!!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/79375.jpg?s=215ca23c073106cea8ac1935a4850d5b", "link": "/anime/31715/Working__Lord_of_the_Takanashi", "name": "Working!!!: Lord of the Takanashi"}], "name-japanese": "(\u767d\u85e4 \u674f\u5b50)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/16913v.jpg", "link": "/people/248/Kumiko_Watanabe", "name": "Watanabe, Kumiko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16929v.jpg", "link": "/people/15593/Mun_Ja_Choi", "name": "Choi, Mun Ja", "language": "Korean"}]}
