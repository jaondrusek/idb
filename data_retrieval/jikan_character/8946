{"about": "Avdol is a rather serious fellow, who wears his heart on his sleeve and is a good source of knowledge. He is extremely dedicated and willing to die for his comrades. He acts as an adviser of sorts, but is also a powerful warrior. He is the most moderate member of the team: not as impulsive and warm-blooded as Polnareff and Joseph, and not as cold as Kakyoin and Jotaro. He serves as the voice of reason to the rest of the team.\n \n  He is killed by Vanilla Ice&#039;s Stand, Cream, after saving Polnareff and Iggy from its attack, losing both of his arms and getting erased from existence after being sucked into Cream&#039;s void. \n\n", "name": "Mohammed Avdol", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/242477.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/180301.jpg?s=125c62d495ebaeeb8c100ccb1a4d26f8", "link": "/manga/872/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/161557.jpg?s=ac2fe02b40d34247d213143f646a6bd9", "link": "/manga/57051/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken"}], "member-favorites": 113, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/53147.jpg?s=62c873e682934376e1d7dddbf651d7df", "link": "/anime/665/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken__Adventure", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Adventure"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/64301.jpg?s=60cd11c8fe90f59b43059a7a27743401", "link": "/anime/666/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/55267.jpg?s=f9e429bb27c7e72be167af8f4774f802", "link": "/anime/20899/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken__Stardust_Crusaders", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/75045.jpg?s=e7fa10712b21a289b9e92912094f977f", "link": "/anime/26055/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken__Stardust_Crusaders_2nd_Season", "name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e2\u30cf\u30e1\u30c9\u30fb\u30a2\u30f4\u30c9\u30a5\u30eb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/49806v.jpg", "link": "/people/339/Kiyoshi_Kobayashi", "name": "Kobayashi, Kiyoshi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42617v.jpg", "link": "/people/720/Kenta_Miyake", "name": "Miyake, Kenta", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/36175v.jpg", "link": "/people/34857/Chris_Tergliafera", "name": "Tergliafera, Chris", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/46121v.jpg", "link": "/people/42556/Marco_Balbi", "name": "Balbi, Marco", "language": "Italian"}]}
