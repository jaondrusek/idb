{"about": "Daikichi is a 30 year old bachelor who has a tendency of scaring away both women and children. Whilst he doesn&#039;t exactly mind that he scares children, as he isn&#039;t too fond of young people, he seems to be lonely as a single man. At his grandfather&#039;s funeral, he meets a newly orphaned illegitimate child, named Rin. In a fit of anger at his relatives&#039; cold shoulder to the girl, he announces that he will be the one to take care of her. Daikichi now finds himself in the role of father, and must adjust his life accordingly.\n \n Daikichi doesn&#039;t have much motivation aside from getting to work each day. When his grandfather passes away, Daikichi feels sorry for the unwanted child that is left behind and takes her in. A bachelor and inexperienced with kids, he has a lot to learn so he can care for Rin properly but with his laid back personality and honest hard work to give her exactly what she needs, Daikichi learns as he goes. His patient, awkward, gentle and straight forward nature works perfectly opposite to Rin&#039;s shy wit. He is constantly learning as a new parent but you can&#039;t help but love him for each mistake he makes.\n\n", "name": "Daikichi Kawachi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/124579.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/122689.jpg?s=9137b94ba83e932ec6b75267cc132e3a", "link": "/manga/3468/Usagi_Drop", "name": "Usagi Drop"}], "member-favorites": 642, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/29665.jpg?s=9df77104db0903e81b099be5180e29cf", "link": "/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop", "name": "Usagi Drop"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/30759.jpg?s=2dc48eb90cb1c031d72ee9ec5f24e8ab", "link": "/anime/11113/Usagi_Drop_Specials", "name": "Usagi Drop Specials"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6cb3\u5730\u5927\u5409)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49042v.jpg", "link": "/people/6214/Hiroshi_Tsuchida", "name": "Tsuchida, Hiroshi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
