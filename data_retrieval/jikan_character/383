{"about": "Status: Prima\n Birth date and place: Aqua, December 24\n Height: 170 cm\n Age: 21\n Blood type: AB\n \n The third \"Water Fairy\", who works for Orange Planet and acts as Alice&#039;s mentor. She tends to be a total airhead who does not really pay attention to anything (in the anime, she once rowed under a bridge and forgot to duck), but genuinely cares about Alice. She was a trainee undine with Alicia and Akira, and often joined them in joint practice sessions much like Akari, Aika, and Alice do now. Athena has a beautiful singing voice, which she uses to entertain her customers and also to help Alice when she is in some kind of trouble. Athena has a strange laugh, it usually comes out sounding as though she is angry. She came to know Alicia and Akira when they were still trainee undine and practised together back then. She tends to be quiet most of the time but happy to join in having fun. Her appellation as a prima undine is \"Seiren\" (denoted as \"Heavenly Voice\"). \n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Athena Glory", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/100718.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/202644.jpg?s=028ba1e6b9452363e4b7bc0f99ebf5a0", "link": "/manga/81/Aria", "name": "Aria"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/171280.jpg?s=fd868b4b7e53512a7595beaace778daf", "link": "/manga/96114/Aria", "name": "Aria"}], "member-favorites": 172, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/77620.jpg?s=aa733e4836b54ac394b01fed27125808", "link": "/anime/477/Aria_The_Animation", "name": "Aria The Animation"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/77621.jpg?s=18c9f04954d6dceb733269e4bb0e5cd5", "link": "/anime/962/Aria_The_Natural", "name": "Aria The Natural"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/77622.jpg?s=81ecafbdd41c4c8f99abdbc27cf98a18", "link": "/anime/2563/Aria_The_OVA__Arietta", "name": "Aria The OVA: Arietta"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/77623.jpg?s=8b993849b72471b704dbf674838db0a1", "link": "/anime/3297/Aria_The_Origination", "name": "Aria The Origination"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/36237.jpg?s=cc01a723756d8230af4247d76db0101f", "link": "/anime/5196/Aria_The_Origination_Picture_Drama", "name": "Aria The Origination Picture Drama"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/10494.jpg?s=2e579528036f9c36b45627de09e7091c", "link": "/anime/5244/Aria_The_Natural__Sono_Futatabi_Deaeru_Kiseki_ni", "name": "Aria The Natural: Sono Futatabi Deaeru Kiseki ni..."}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/74338.jpg?s=13a27e948e01a7f2e396bc2adf47f1f0", "link": "/anime/29893/Aria_The_Avvenire", "name": "Aria The Avvenire"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30c6\u30ca\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30a3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/10138v.jpg", "link": "/people/71/Tomoko_Kawakami", "name": "Kawakami, Tomoko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/9992/Laura_Brambilla", "name": "Brambilla, Laura", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15409v.jpg", "link": "/people/14837/Myeong_Seon_Lee", "name": "Lee, Myeong Seon", "language": "Korean"}]}
