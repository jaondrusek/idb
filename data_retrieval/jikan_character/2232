{"about": "<b>Age:</b> 19 (A's), 25 (End of A's), 29 (StrikerS), 33 (ViVid), 35 (Force)\n <b>Eye Color:</b> Blue\n <b>Hair color:</b> Pink\n <b>Intelligent Device:</b> Laevatein, Agito (StrikerS), Gladiator (Force)\n <b>Rank:</b> S- (Air)\n \n <b>Nanoha A's</b>\n Signum enters the story when Vita has attempted to steal Nanoha Takamachi's Linker Core (a mage's source of magic) for the Book of Darkness. Since the arrival of Nanoha's cavalry, Fate Testarossa and Y\u016bno Scrya, Vita is cornered and Signum must come to her rescue with Shamal. The Wolkenritter overpower the TSAB troupe with their use of high-powered magical cartridges, and Signum manages to snap Fate's staff, Bardiche, in half. The battle ends with Shamal finally managing to get Nanoha's Linker Core and Nanoha breaking Vita's barrier. Signum refuses to take a bath that night for fear of Hayate seeing the injuries sustained in her battle with Fate.\n \n Signum may appear emotionless, but she is completely dedicated to Hayate, and as the leader of the Wolkenritter, fights for the others as well. The Wolkenritter attack mages to steal their Linker Cores, their sources of magic, to fill the 666 pages of the Book of Darkness with this power before it saps any more of Hayate's and she becomes fully paralyzed. They continue to obtain Linker Cores and fight off interference from the Time-Space Administration Bureau (TSAB), mainly Fate- with whom Signum faces off during every battle, and whose strength she respects- and Nanoha, while they try to keep Hayate from knowing that they are stealing magic for pages; she has told them that as long as she is mistress of the Book, she will not allow anyone to be harmed over it.\n \n Signum, determined to save Hayate even if it means going against her wishes, convinces the other Wolkenritter to fill up the Book of Darkness anyway. What the Wolkenritter don't know about Hayate is that the Book, once completed, may stop sapping her Linker Core for pages, but that does not mean that it will stop hurting her or undo its damage. In fact, the master of the Book dies upon its completion. Signum continues to masquerade as a distant relative of Hayate's while covering up their deeds. Shamal notes that Signum used to be completely emotionless, and ordered the other Wolkenritter to act as such in accordance with their purpose, but once Hayate came along and treated them like family, Signum began to smile.\n \n <b>Nanoha StrikerS</b>\n Ten years after the epilogue of A's, Signum became the sub-commander of the Lightning Squad of the TSAB, working under Fate, who worked under Hayate. Unlike Vita, however, she did not participate in training the trainees, under the pretense that she is an old fashioned knight and can only teach to them is to get close to their enemies and rip them apart. However, near the end half of the series, she accepted the request of Erio Mondial to spar with him.\n \n During the attack of Saint's Cradle, Signum fought with Knight Zest Grangeitz, who united with Agito. She performed unison with Reinforce Zwei, but only managed to end the fight with a draw. The fight continues inside the headquarters of Capital City Defense Forces, and Signum came out victorious. In his dying breath, Zest asks her to take care of Agito and Lutecia Alpino.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Signum ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/226519.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/30379.jpg?s=7ed8f80b53957f3e43ea5621589f19ea", "link": "/manga/1231/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS_THE_COMICS", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS THE COMICS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33371.jpg?s=3cf84b07307ec9b7920518bc0d01cdda", "link": "/manga/3236/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/27278.jpg?s=517c1f9f6b48bb340bfa7357840b172f", "link": "/manga/13268/Mahou_Senki_Lyrical_Nanoha_Force", "name": "Mahou Senki Lyrical Nanoha Force"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/27365.jpg?s=d389ab709e806b0248cd255267082934", "link": "/manga/14238/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/100787.jpg?s=ed32d248e5a98a7ab5ecbb9cfb810fe9", "link": "/manga/42129/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_Innocent", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Innocent"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/89397.jpg?s=592f882f4e92400aacbfa82880ef3276", "link": "/manga/50595/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__The_Movie_2nd_As_-_Tribute_Comics", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's - Tribute Comics"}], "member-favorites": 139, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/6767.jpg?s=61c04ef360484caac42b3bb2ed0111fe", "link": "/anime/77/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/14190.jpg?s=68b6dd368fdb758322a277027dfe9dec", "link": "/anime/1915/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/35733.jpg?s=676cc6d4d769c83171f5081962c33bb3", "link": "/anime/10153/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__The_Movie_2nd_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/88348.jpg?s=12ee1de47d83186ddb15fcff3da0f390", "link": "/anime/17947/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Reflection", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Reflection"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/72718.jpg?s=5e4c1aed0f4c9e4808e5f43549f1a8eb", "link": "/anime/25939/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/86963.jpg?s=420b692e2e7627285f58a2d65185b567", "link": "/anime/35984/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Detonation", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Detonation"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b7\u30b0\u30ca\u30e0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/27739v.jpg", "link": "/people/169/Kaori_Shimizu", "name": "Shimizu, Kaori", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/8653v.jpg", "link": "/people/10279/Bailey_Chadwick", "name": "Chadwick, Bailey", "language": "English"}]}
