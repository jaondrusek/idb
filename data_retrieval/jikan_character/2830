She is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Neptune in the final episode of Sailor Moon R. When transformed, she is known as Sailor Uranus, and is part of the group known in Fanon as the Outer Senshi. \n \n Haruka is a racecar driver, even though she is barely sixteen years old when she appears. However, the timing of her birthday to the Japanese school year means she is one grade ahead of the Inner Senshi. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n", "name": "Haruka Tenou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/85595.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/126449.jpg?s=2b261a069f71e242456cfed97ea7b3c3", "link": "/manga/92/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon", "name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon"}], "member-favorites": 974, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/532.jpg?s=befc5e1b9c0a337636204d7153692443", "link": "/anime/532/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_S", "name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/996.jpg?s=2fe9bb19ce2695362dcc2637eb2d97a0", "link": "/anime/996/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon__Sailor_Stars", "name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/18896.jpg?s=819a704e53f1fceaa929f99c8e216b7f", "link": "/anime/997/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_S__Kaguya_Hime_no_Koibito", "name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kaguya Hime no Koibito"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/17831.jpg?s=ef6328e01b862246c259e029c90ef1a5", "link": "/anime/1240/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS__Sailor_9_Senshi_Shuuketsu_Black_Dream_Hole_no_Kiseki", "name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS: Sailor 9 Senshi Shuuketsu!
