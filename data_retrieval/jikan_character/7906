{"about": "Riiya may look like a regular boy, but he can actually transform into a wolf at will, with no need for a full moon, and harbors inhuman strength. He is one of Chacha's two closest friends, the other being Shiine, whom he fights with for Chacha's oblivious affection. Riiya also loves food, and is frequently cuddled by Chacha for being, in her mind, incredibly adorable in his wolf form.\n\n", "name": "Riiya ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/113853.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/10136.jpg?s=5da38cc579eef5c29199d5561f97c85d", "link": "/manga/7270/Akazukin_Chacha", "name": "Akazukin Chacha"}], "member-favorites": 6, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/2792.jpg?s=abc438c15103da4e8cb81dc6aaa31114", "link": "/anime/103/Akazukin_Chacha", "name": "Akazukin Chacha"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/23206.jpg?s=71cd9800e0a685baed65d453537b7a75", "link": "/anime/367/Akazukin_Chacha_OVA", "name": "Akazukin Chacha OVA"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ea\u30fc\u30e4)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1284v.jpg", "link": "/people/1160/Davide_Garbolino", "name": "Garbolino, Davide", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/36417v.jpg", "link": "/people/7252/Shingo_Katori", "name": "Katori, Shingo", "language": "Japanese"}]}
