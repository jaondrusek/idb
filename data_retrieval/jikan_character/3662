{"about": "Isaac Dian forms one half of the bumbling thief couple, who seem to cross into everybody's story in one way or another. He's in love with Miria, and they've robbed everything and anything, from doors to the entire Genoard household. He's completely clueless, super eccentric and happy-go-lucky to the point you can't stop laughing from his bold and sometimes completely weird actions.\n \n He has a cameo appearance in Durarara!!\n\n", "name": "Isaac Dian", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/117856.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/172736.jpg?s=cda4701f463d9614f81ac7a39ae8a158", "link": "/manga/1342/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}], "member-favorites": 3548, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/14547.jpg?s=f4369a764b56bf0d0c54277abe556d21", "link": "/anime/2251/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/9129.jpg?s=9debdff6e336558c8465808d01e5524f", "link": "/anime/3901/Baccano_Specials", "name": "Baccano!
