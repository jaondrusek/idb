{"about": "Birthday: June 21\n \n Yachiyo is another employee at the restaurant and is 20 years old. She usually carries around a katana which, according to her, was made by her parents who used to be blacksmiths. Yachiyo is unaware that some of the customers, and even Souta, are intimidated by her blade. She admires Kyouko considerably. She gets angry if anyone offers Kyouko food or tries to take her away, although is willing to allow Satou to feed her because she considers him trustworthy, much to his chagrin.\n \n In chapter 219, she gladly agreed to date Satou. Their relationship is gradually accepted by Kyouko.\n\n", "name": "Yachiyo Todoroki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/87270.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/3306.jpg?s=92f8946ad038cdb5c578039ee8c087d8", "link": "/manga/3044/Working", "name": "Working!!"}], "member-favorites": 114, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/75262.jpg?s=855dab8aa122f8c180f9d6ecf5f63f8f", "link": "/anime/6956/Working", "name": "Working!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/75263.jpg?s=5976a4419f057ae1a68dd9b85813a04a", "link": "/anime/10521/Working", "name": "Working'!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/73886.jpg?s=2d8f16c3cacb9d793dbde65b211520cd", "link": "/anime/25879/Working", "name": "Working!!!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/79375.jpg?s=215ca23c073106cea8ac1935a4850d5b", "link": "/anime/31715/Working__Lord_of_the_Takanashi", "name": "Working!!!: Lord of the Takanashi"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8f5f \u516b\u5343\u4ee3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/50751v.jpg", "link": "/people/413/Eri_Kitamura", "name": "Kitamura, Eri", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15463v.jpg", "link": "/people/14865/Soyeon", "name": "Soyeon", "language": "Korean"}]}
