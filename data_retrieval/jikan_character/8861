{"about": "One of Advena Avis immortals. Aside from Elmer, Huey sees everyone, including his own children, as possible test subjects for his experiments.\n \n Huey has many groups, of both humans and non-humans (his homunculi), working under him, like the Lemures and the Lamia. In the 1930s, Huey is arrested for terrorism and sent to Alcatraz. However, he still seems to be able to communicate with outside world, aggravating Victor to no end.\n \n Huey's mother was killed during the witch hunts which left him angry at humanity and wary of others. However, after meeting Elmer he begins to open up again, and even lets himself fall in love with Monica.\n \n Unfortunately, Monica was killed by Fermet, which greatly effected Huey's personality and goals.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Huey Laforet", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/117873.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/172736.jpg?s=cda4701f463d9614f81ac7a39ae8a158", "link": "/manga/1342/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}], "member-favorites": 49, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/14547.jpg?s=f4369a764b56bf0d0c54277abe556d21", "link": "/anime/2251/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/9129.jpg?s=9debdff6e336558c8465808d01e5524f", "link": "/anime/3901/Baccano_Specials", "name": "Baccano!
