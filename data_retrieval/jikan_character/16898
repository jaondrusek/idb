{"about": "Chang was originally from China. He was an impoverished Chinese farmer in his early 40s who once owned a pig farm; almost all of his pigs ran away and he was starving and suffering under heavy taxes. Hopeless, Chang decided to end his misery by hanging himself. However, he was \"saved\" by a bullet from Black Ghost which cut the noose. Chang fainted and was later delivered to the Black Ghost laboratory (In the 2001 series, he owns a restaurant - explaining why he&#039;s such a good cook - but burns it down after doing a fire-breathing trick, then he loses everything else. Black Ghost agents pick him up when he faints.) 006&#039;s power allows him to breathe huge flames. This ability also allows 006 to create tunnels in the earth and attack enemies with underground explosions. Aside from that, he&#039;s a jovial fellow who is well-versed in the ways of cooking; his refined cuisine and happy personality always manage to bring his teammates back to good spirits.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Chang Changku", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/112972.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/198945.jpg?s=21b8dd35fdfebefb212c9f2b2200b8e8", "link": "/manga/1639/Cyborg_009", "name": "Cyborg 009"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/163640.jpg?s=f42c0ab2154f415eb7d01b27d27ce820", "link": "/manga/42755/009_Re_Cyborg", "name": "009 Re:Cyborg"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/176612.jpg?s=618ca3bf8f34ed2eaf2e357ec68fb856", "link": "/manga/95091/Cyborg_009_VS_Devilman__Breakdown", "name": "Cyborg 009 VS Devilman: Breakdown"}], "member-favorites": 1, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/21620.jpg?s=d6603f7e2972ed848e749c7cae4b741c", "link": "/anime/1678/Cyborg_009__The_Cyborg_Soldier", "name": "Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/56741.jpg?s=4fbfe83b3d3771427eccdec6983a7aa9", "link": "/anime/4690/Cyborg_009_1979", "name": "Cyborg 009 (1979)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/76035.jpg?s=2eb7e8d7957de0c8b630dc5068c8d89e", "link": "/anime/6872/Cyborg_009", "name": "Cyborg 009"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/76036.jpg?s=b21d029cd854831155473b9011006921", "link": "/anime/7290/Cyborg_009__Kaijuu_Sensou", "name": "Cyborg 009: Kaijuu Sensou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/17466.jpg?s=ab271322bf1910afc39d530ee81f3273", "link": "/anime/7336/Cyborg_009__Chou_Ginga_Densetsu", "name": "Cyborg 009: Chou Ginga Densetsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/22076.jpg?s=8e67a4454be9194236558a2169122e4a", "link": "/anime/8394/Cyborg_009_TV", "name": "Cyborg 009 (TV)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/40189.jpg?s=2c460427027f224d8dda8e13695c2645", "link": "/anime/11755/009_Re_Cyborg", "name": "009 Re:Cyborg"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/76057.jpg?s=a09c70a3af5572b3be2107ca684a5374", "link": "/anime/31050/Cyborg_009_VS_Devilman", "name": "Cyborg 009 VS Devilman"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/81018.jpg?s=697fd609a9e1cd718fe64862bd25aa83", "link": "/anime/33685/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_1", "name": "Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 1"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/81019.jpg?s=e66331131d4c486c9046a448d48fe513", "link": "/anime/33686/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_2", "name": "Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/81020.jpg?s=5f710a2e9b28843c52277121d0f793aa", "link": "/anime/33687/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_3", "name": "Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 3"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5f35\u3005 \u6e56)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15923v.jpg", "link": "/people/394/Mitsuaki_Madono", "name": "Madono, Mitsuaki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/40992v.jpg", "link": "/people/512/Michael_Sorich", "name": "Sorich, Michael", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/11092v.jpg", "link": "/people/831/Chafurin", "name": "Chafurin", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/41889v.jpg", "link": "/people/990/Steve_Kramer", "name": "Kramer, Steve", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/12847v.jpg", "link": "/people/1452/Yuu_Mizushima", "name": "Mizushima, Yuu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/31455v.jpg", "link": "/people/5277/Sanji_Hase", "name": "Hase, Sanji", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32971v.jpg", "link": "/people/6730/Ichiro_Nagai", "name": "Nagai, Ichiro", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/40653v.jpg", "link": "/people/6962/Joe_Ochman", "name": "Ochman, Joe", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42041v.jpg", "link": "/people/40335/Hans_Hohlbein", "name": "Hohlbein, Hans", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/43825/Paulo_Porto", "name": "Porto, Paulo", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/47626v.jpg", "link": "/people/44106/Jens_Wendland", "name": "Wendland, Jens", "language": "German"}]}
