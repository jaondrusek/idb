{"about": "Our hero is a 14 year old boy whose real name is unknown, but he goes by the codename Gunvolt. When the story begins, he is a member of the armed resistance movement named QUILL, whose sole purpose is to fight against the Sumeragi Group. Although he is a cool, level-headed guy most of the time, Gunvolt&rsquo;s youthful rebellious streak tends to rear itself when he is forced to do things that go against his principles. His septima, known as the Azure Striker, grants him the ability to control lightning.\n \n (Source: Gunvolt Official English Website)\n\n", "name": "Gunvolt ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/316918.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 6, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/85631.jpg?s=daf2a6ed7bcd7d462d945c1f83777c5a", "link": "/anime/33564/Armed_Blue_Gunvolt", "name": "Armed Blue Gunvolt"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ac\u30f3\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30c8)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/47102v.jpg", "link": "/people/20156/Kaito_Ishikawa", "name": "Ishikawa, Kaito", "language": "Japanese"}]}
