{"about": "Age: 17\n Birthday: April 8 (Aries)\n Height: 183 cm (6&#039;0\")\n Blood Type: A\n Host type: \"Prince\"\n Nationality: half-French, half-Japanese\n Favorite Subjects: English, French, History\n Favorite Foods: common folk ramen (esp. pork flavor) and snacks (esp. baby star)\n Rose color: white\n \n Tamaki Suou is the founder and president of the Ouran High School Host Club. He is the antithesis to his best friend, Kyoya Ootori. While Kyoya is calm, cool, and calculating, Tamaki is flamboyant, emotional, and narcissistic; however, he is extremely dedicated to his duties as a host. He is the \"prince\" host type, who can charm any girl with sweet talk&mdash;yet he is always truthful in his compliments. To him, all girls are pretty, and the happiness of his guest is his greatest enjoyment. Tamaki acts as the main comic relief in the series, exemplified in his extremely dense and na&iuml;ve approach to his own feelings, and extreme emotional reactions to Haruhi&#039;s comments about his stupidity. He has a family complex, as he asks Haruhi to call him \"Daddy\" and refers to Kyoya as \"Mommy.\" He is shown to be partial to classical piano music and plays extremely well; one of his favorite pieces being Mozart&#039;s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.\n \n Tamaki is revealed to be half-French and half-Japanese. His real name is Rene Tamaki Richard Grantaine. His father, the superintendent of Ouran Academy, fell in love with Tamaki&#039;s French mother and divorced his first wife to marry her. For that reason, Tamaki&#039;s paternal grandmother harbors a strong hatred towards Tamaki. Nevertheless, he is constantly trying to get her to accept him as part of the Suou family. Because of his family situation, Tamaki sees the Host Club as one big family and tries to maintain that illusion, to the extent of telling himself that his love for Haruhi is fatherly even when it is clearly not.\n \n Later in the manga, Tamaki gets closer to Haruhi even though he says it&#039;s mostly like a father; however, he tells Kyoya the reason why he hasn&#039;t been cheerful is because of his stricken love for Haruhi.\n [Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n", "name": "Tamaki Suou", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/48467.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/19240.jpg?s=8b4e16c145de8d076de1e7a522f73252", "link": "/manga/30/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33182.jpg?s=16a536c8097bc213d65d6909933da9c0", "link": "/manga/20777/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/39258.jpg?s=740f334574cfcccebe6ee3759e5262f2", "link": "/manga/24339/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_Short_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club Short Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/59387.jpg?s=a1eb51dff2dab27b13cb812a81763734", "link": "/manga/27029/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club_University_Special", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club University Special"}], "member-favorites": 7570, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/71992.jpg?s=721d5f3166e936ee69187e4bc004f319", "link": "/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club", "name": "Ouran Koukou Host Club"}], "name-japanese": "(\u9808\u738b \u74b0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/29839v.jpg", "link": "/people/43/Vic_Mignogna", "name": "Mignogna, Vic", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42141v.jpg", "link": "/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano", "name": "Miyano, Mamoru", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/6817v.jpg", "link": "/people/8847/Asad_Schwarz-Msesilamba", "name": "Schwarz-Msesilamba, Asad", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15289v.jpg", "link": "/people/14753/Su_Jin_Kang", "name": "Kang, Su Jin", "language": "Korean"}]}
