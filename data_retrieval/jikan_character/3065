{"about": "Ladd is a sadistic hit-man for the Russo family. His love for acts of violence truly shows in the maniacal glee he exhibits while fighting or killing. He is exceptionally skilled in hand-to-hand combat\u2014particularly boxing\u2014and the use of firearms. He is most happy while killing people that think they will never die and by seeing dead people or hearing gunfights. Ladd is deeply in love with his fianc\u00e9e, Lua, although he expresses it through a passionate promise to kill her someday. \n\n", "name": "Ladd Russo", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/87774.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/172736.jpg?s=cda4701f463d9614f81ac7a39ae8a158", "link": "/manga/1342/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/84135.jpg?s=2e65a04a157bd2647748ec449788c914", "link": "/manga/10814/Baccano_1931_The_Grand_Punk_Railroad", "name": "Baccano! 1931 The Grand Punk Railroad"}], "member-favorites": 1524, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/14547.jpg?s=f4369a764b56bf0d0c54277abe556d21", "link": "/anime/2251/Baccano", "name": "Baccano!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/9129.jpg?s=9debdff6e336558c8465808d01e5524f", "link": "/anime/3901/Baccano_Specials", "name": "Baccano!
