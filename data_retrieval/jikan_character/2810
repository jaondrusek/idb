{"about": "The Inorganic Angel Rosiel is the younger twin of Alexiel. Originally, he was wise, kind and benevolent, but knew he would eventually lose his sanity and become destructive. He asked Alexiel to kill him before this happened, but her feelings prevented her from doing so and she sealed him within the earth instead. He is also obsessed with his beauty; because everyone calls him beautiful (save for Alexiel), he frequently asks if he is beautiful as he descends further into insanity. In fact, he intentionally mimics many of Alexiel's facial features, which explains his resemblance to his sister. In reality, Rosiel was born as an old, hideous creature. His body doesn't age; instead, it becomes younger and younger as time goes by. Rosiel's most loyal follower Katan secretly uses forbidden black magic to break the seal and brings Rosiel back. By this time, Rosiel has already lost his mind.\n\n", "name": "Rosiel ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/82420.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/176257.jpg?s=0ac9405585994278f49ff97558ea9b13", "link": "/manga/448/Tenshi_Kinryouku", "name": "Tenshi Kinryouku"}], "member-favorites": 114, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/45208.jpg?s=aa872a6af05f3f49d771fb8e9db33d75", "link": "/anime/51/Tenshi_Kinryouku", "name": "Tenshi Kinryouku"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ed\u30b7\u30a8\u30eb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/40664v.jpg", "link": "/people/19/Crispin_Freeman", "name": "Freeman, Crispin", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/213v.jpg", "link": "/people/260/Susumu_Chiba", "name": "Chiba, Susumu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1262v.jpg", "link": "/people/1266/Roberto_Chevalier", "name": "Chevalier, Roberto", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/2734v.jpg", "link": "/people/1661/Gerrit_Schmidt-Fo\u00df", "name": "Schmidt-Fo\u00df, Gerrit", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/23062v.jpg", "link": "/people/20334/Carlos_Di_Blasi", "name": "Di Blasi, Carlos", "language": "Spanish"}]}
