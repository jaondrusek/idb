{"about": "Great Britain, whose real name is unknown, was unsurprisingly originally from the United Kingdom. He was once a famous and talented stage actor with a broad knowledge of famous shows. In the 2001 TV series, Great Britain was in love with an actress named Sophie, who worked with him. Later he became more famous and gradually ignored his past love. One financial problem after another arose, and the once great thespian was reduced over time to the life of a penniless nobody who would do anything for a drink or a smoke. Black Ghost agents, noticing his plight, easily lured Great Britain into their vehicle with an alcoholic beverage. Later after his escape with the other cyborgs, Great Britain goes back to the United Kingdom and finds out that his ex-girlfriend had a daughter, Rosa. With the possibility that she might be his child, Great Britain tries to talk to her but is unfortunately rejected and scorned for his past actions (Rosa believed him to have betrayed Sophie), to be redeemed only in the end when he replaces a main actor in Rosa&#039;s theatrical play and manages to befriend her. 007 has the incredible ability to reshape his cellular structure at will, allowing him to become any object, creature, or person he wishes (at one point in the 2001 series, he even grows to titanic proportions). With his superb acting skills, he can also blend in with the enemy to use sneaky maneuvers and attacks. Although he is the oldest of the second generation cyborgs, being in his late 40s when kidnapped, 007 is probably the most lighthearted one and is a very amiable guy to boot. Giving credence to his personality as a comic relief, there is a running gag where Great Britain often takes the form of a precocious, almost super deformed, child; he would act as a spoiled child fearing for own life amidst his fellow Cyborgs even during combat. In the 1960s anime versions, he is a child rather than an adult, in an attempt by the producers to appeal to a younger audience. Though Ishinomori initially disapproved of this, he later temporarily mirrored it in the manga version by having Gilmore alter 007&#039;s body to make the child form his standard form. His nationality in combination with his number is an obvious reference to Ian Fleming&#039;s famous British spy character James Bond.\n\n", "name": "Great Britain ", "image":
