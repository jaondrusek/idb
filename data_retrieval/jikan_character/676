{"about": "The main character. The series follows his rapid development from living an average life to becoming an outstanding guitarist. Being a weak individual lacking an authoritative presence, he cannot help but let others push him around, a possible metaphoric stereotype on the very proper and manner conscious Japanese society. Recruited as the last member of BECK, he serves as the second guitarist and vocalist, and has a very beautiful voice that is mostly used for Beck's slower songs. He owns a Fender Telecaster.\n\n", "name": "Yukio Tanaka", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/81454.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/171795.jpg?s=2a3f2457e3ed36d11b375913c84f1264", "link": "/manga/145/Beck", "name": "Beck"}], "member-favorites": 803, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/11636.jpg?s=8b19d94199584ce32eba8ab47081ff5a", "link": "/anime/57/Beck", "name": "Beck"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7530\u4e2d \u5e78\u96c4)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/17137v.jpg", "link": "/people/87/Daisuke_Namikawa", "name": "Namikawa, Daisuke", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/12455v.jpg", "link": "/people/192/Greg_Ayres", "name": "Ayres, Greg", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/21655v.jpg", "link": "/people/776/Daniele_Raffaeli", "name": "Raffaeli, Daniele", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28677v.jpg", "link": "/people/26561/Nicolas_Beaucaire", "name": "Beaucaire, Nicolas", "language": "French"}]}
