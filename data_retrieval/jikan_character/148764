{"about": "Takumi is the head of the track and field team. He has good grades as well and ever since he was a first year student, he has continued to make it to the prefectural competition every year for sprints. As such, he is an accomplished athlete and student. Takumi naturally pays attention to those around him, and is a person of character whom is frequently relied upon. Akane also joined the track and field team, and Takumi has been thinking about her ever since. He, of course, has never told anyone about this. However other than Akane, it seems that others vaguely notice.\n\n", "name": "Takumi Hira", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/327240.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 3, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/85592.jpg?s=d5edd787403c0318515177bd09b739b2", "link": "/anime/34822/Tsuki_ga_Kirei", "name": "Tsuki ga Kirei"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6bd4\u826f \u62d3\u6d77)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/35989v.jpg", "link": "/people/8639/Atsushi_Tamaru", "name": "Tamaru, Atsushi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48658v.jpg", "link": "/people/36888/Daman_Mills", "name": "Mills, Daman", "language": "English"}]}
