{"about": "The second Rozen Maiden doll, who is as adorable as she is eccentric. Not only does she constantly refer to herself in third person, but she also talks about taking her sisters' Rosa Mysticae, though she repeatedly fails in her attempts to do so. She fancies herself as quite the stealthy prowler, and makes a hobby of watching the exploits of her sisters, usually through binoculars. Kanaria's bright, somewhat arrogant disposition makes her the ideal subject for many of the comedic episodes. Despite this, she is a competent opponent and attacks with a deceptively adorable violin that destroys through its sound. Her personality mostly complements that of Hinaichigo, who eventually becomes her good friend and rival.\n \n Kanaria has the unusual habit of ending her sentences with \"kashira\" (\"I wonder?\" or \"maybe?\"), which is likened to Hinaichigo's penchant for ending sentences with \"na no\" (meaning \"Because\"). Kanaria's favorite food is tamagoyaki, or Japanese thick omelet, which, more often than not, is snatched away from her by hungry birds before she can enjoy it. She is introduced in the second season and makes a brief appearance in Rozen Maiden: Ouverture, making yet another humorously over-the-top attempt to infiltrate Jun's home to steal her sisters' Rosa Mysticae.\n \n Her artificial spirit is named after the technique of playing orchestral instruments by plucking the strings, which she uses as a counterattack.\n \n Medium: Mitsu\n Artificial Spirit: Pizzicato\n \n Kanaria's name in English means \"canary\".\n\n", "name": "Kanaria ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/77226.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/169707.jpg?s=b6da1c07cdba328c908acb8215d307d2", "link": "/manga/98/Rozen_Maiden", "name": "Rozen Maiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/113855.jpg?s=36357972a8a4eb8d8e0e847ddce51dc8", "link": "/manga/7728/Rozen_Maiden_2008", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2008)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/187214.jpg?s=77e07b306a1c1867aa39fb2f40294ee9", "link": "/manga/95216/Rozen_Maiden_Zero", "name": "Rozen Maiden Zero"}], "member-favorites": 74, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/10242.jpg?s=569b3ddc923bc9551843a1d445353f46", "link": "/anime/65/Rozen_Maiden__Tr\u00e4umend", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Tr\u00e4umend"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/1719.jpg?s=eb1faceb0bd7beff219f2d5b2258749c", "link": "/anime/1719/Rozen_Maiden__Ouvert\u00fcre", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Ouvert\u00fcre"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/52079.jpg?s=dff6fc156fa86b2d34d34b073162bbab", "link": "/anime/18041/Rozen_Maiden_2013", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2013)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u91d1\u7cf8\u96c0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37923v.jpg", "link": "/people/159/Monica_Rial", "name": "Rial, Monica", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20679v.jpg", "link": "/people/166/Yumi_Shimura", "name": "Shimura, Yumi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44707v.jpg", "link": "/people/489/Cristina_Valenzuela", "name": "Valenzuela, Cristina", "language": "English"}]}
