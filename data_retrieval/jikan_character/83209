{"about": "Mei is an honor student, the chairman&#039;s granddaughter, and student council president. She is stern, cold, and often calm and composed, but she can be rather sensitive and mature to some extent. At first, there is little to know about her and a bad impression of Mei washes over Yuzu, which causes Yuzu to take interest on Mei later on. Though Mei seems to be hard to approach, she is rather sensitive and lonely which makes Yuzu want to care for Mei more.\n\n", "name": "Mei Aihara", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/228021.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/185905.jpg?s=aac6974ad5284cd9b1b720e8191a2cc3", "link": "/manga/50145/Citrus", "name": "Citrus"}], "member-favorites": 360, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/87555.jpg?s=f66d1a5d309b33ce30941295e48e8b88", "link": "/anime/34382/Citrus", "name": "Citrus"}], "name-japanese": "(\u85cd\u539f \u82bd\u8863)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/35965v.jpg", "link": "/people/11492/Minami_Tsuda", "name": "Tsuda, Minami", "language": "Japanese"}]}
