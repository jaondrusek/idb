{"about": "A black cat who wears a scarf created by the Professor, which allows him to speak. Being theoretically older than both Nano and the Professor when converting cat years to human years, he speaks in a condescending tone towards them and wants to be called \"Sakamoto-san\", though he often succumbs to his catlike habits.\n \n In the last episode, it is revealed that Sakamoto used to be Nakamura&#039;s cat and was called \"Taisho\". Sakamoto does not want to return to Nakamura because she did not take good care of him, even though she had good intentions.\n\n", "name": "Sakamoto ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/112679.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/164728.jpg?s=98a2537cc5378d9826d6215912522601", "link": "/manga/3082/Nichijou", "name": "Nichijou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/190967.jpg?s=2feb23062c1fe344d414ed260f760ede", "link": "/manga/26973/Helvetica_Standard", "name": "Helvetica Standard"}], "member-favorites": 1429, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/25521.jpg?s=1d880ba57c741848d2e59cdb46875d5a", "link": "/anime/8857/Nichijou__Nichijou_no_0-wa", "name": "Nichijou: Nichijou no 0-wa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/75617.jpg?s=529679acd5b3891809fba64003917a8f", "link": "/anime/10165/Nichijou", "name": "Nichijou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/29848.jpg?s=8f528ece55681f9e2b1cfcca40b21324", "link": "/anime/10807/Nichijou__Original_Jikai_Yokoku", "name": "Nichijou: Original Jikai Yokoku"}], "name-japanese": "(\u962a\u672c)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/8862v.jpg", "link": "/people/261/Minoru_Shiraishi", "name": "Shiraishi, Minoru", "language": "Japanese"}]}
