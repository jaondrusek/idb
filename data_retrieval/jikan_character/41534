{"about": "Birthday: March 14\n \n Kisa is a fellow editor in the Emerald department, and because of his \"baby face\" he is mistaken for being much younger than his true age of 30. He&#039;s never been in a serious relationship and doesn&#039;t think himself capable of being in one because of his tendency to fall in love for only good looks without knowing a guy&#039;s personality. Because of this, he immediately questions his feelings for Kou and doesn&#039;t hold out much hope for a relationship with him. His mentality can be described by his line: \"love at first sight works well enough in a manga, but this is reality.\"\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Shouta Kisa", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/125821.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/11604.jpg?s=b68435bfa29c5a5c0d3e7a6cbc84adee", "link": "/manga/765/Junjou_Romantica", "name": "Junjou Romantica"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/14369.jpg?s=e251f4583ed9927114090babbfcca515", "link": "/manga/10573/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Onodera_Ritsu_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Onodera Ritsu no Baai"}], "member-favorites": 250, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/29763.jpg?s=62c940272d145be1beb8cc2e524c1fc8", "link": "/anime/9926/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/34871.jpg?s=4446ddce68f9b3002d41525c5482aaa1", "link": "/anime/11123/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_2", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/55723.jpg?s=caa44a790ff16b409b6f3b008d957782", "link": "/anime/20815/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Valentine-hen", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Valentine-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6728\u4f50 \u7fd4\u592a)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44023v.jpg", "link": "/people/270/Nobuhiko_Okamoto", "name": "Okamoto, Nobuhiko", "language": "Japanese"}]}
