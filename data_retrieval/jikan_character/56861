{"about": "Age: 15\n Birthday: December 25\n Class: 1st year high school student\n Height: 193 cm (6&#039;3\")\n Weight: 72 kg\n \n Sentaro is a wild 1st-year high school student who meets incoming student Kaoru at Higashi High School. Sentaro is mistakenly thought of as a thug by his peers, who fear him. Though tall and gifted with prodigious physical strength, Sentaro is also straightforward and bighearted. He&#039;s the exact opposite of Kaoru, yet somehow they hit it off when Sentaro starts to share his boundless love for jazz. The drums are Sentaro&#039;s instrument of choice.\n\n", "name": "Sentarou Kawabuchi", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/173351.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/62627.jpg?s=0c08f841788e1a0064a1eccdc0354809", "link": "/manga/28393/Sakamichi_no_Apollon", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/82944.jpg?s=9b4f61c23febe38a489dd1b7e006e017", "link": "/manga/47022/Sakamichi_no_Apollon__Bonus_Track", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon: Bonus Track"}], "member-favorites": 902, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/79781.jpg?s=414355e27eaed55465b6faa58db43781", "link": "/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon", "name": "Sakamichi no Apollon"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5ddd\u6e15 \u5343\u592a\u90ce)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39304v.jpg", "link": "/people/1848/Andrew_Love", "name": "Love, Andrew", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44652v.jpg", "link": "/people/5626/Yoshimasa_Hosoya", "name": "Hosoya, Yoshimasa", "language": "Japanese"}]}
