{"about": "Fuuka is the daughter of Suzuka and Yamato from the prequel <i>Suzuka</i>.\n \n Fuuka is an energetic girl who is quick to anger, but also willing to admit when she is wrong and generally easy going and friendly. She has a willful, sincere personality that mysteriously inspires others and attracts people to her. Her age is currently unknown, but is estimated around 15, seeing that she is still in first year of high school. (She and Yuu are both in class 1-A at their high school.)\n \n Despite seeming to enjoy life and being generally upbeat, she sometimes feels frustrated like she is missing something in her life. She doesn&#039;t seem to have much of an interest in track and field, even though her parents are top athletes. (She did do track and field in middle school, but didn&#039;t find it satisfying towards her feelings of frustration.) Nachi, a member of the track and field team, frequently tries to convince her to join.\n \n In chapter 6: Yuu, after discussing Fuuka&#039;s frustration and uneasiness with Mikasa, talks with Fuuka about it and, while visiting the shrine that her parents frequented in <i>Suzuka</i>, she tells him that listening to music usually makes her feelings of frustration go away. He suggests that she try making music, if that is what puts her at ease. She is inspired by Yuu&#039;s suggestion and decides then and there to pursue music seriously. At that moment, Yuu sees a vision of \"great wings of light\" springing from Fuuka&#039;s back.\n She gets into a car accident in chapter 36 when she was picking up her cellphone strap which dropped on the ground. It was officially confirmed that she had died in chapter 37.\n \n In the anime, Fuuka barely survives getting hit by the truck. Unfortunately, this near-death experience, coupled with her growing feelings for Yuu, causes her to quit from the band and consider going solo. It&#039;s only after admitting her feelings for Yuu that she gets the strength to return to the band.\n\n", "name": "Fuuka Akitsuki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/236275.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/184775.jpg?s=cf692998668f850b8b6141dcdd71fb11", "link": "/manga/430/Suzuka", "name": "Suzuka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/115221.jpg?s=04ea19e7b5c10ab7135487d5f303e002", "link": "/manga/8483/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi", "name": "Kimi no Iru Machi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/186209.jpg?s=649cc2fdfd72b6185c0c653c76fd9ca8", "link": "/manga/67019/Fuuka", "name": "Fuuka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/130719.jpg?s=a9bc9fa50a8bfd2119940143ecbd8de5", "link": "/manga/75053/Magazine_Heroines_on_the_Beach", "name": "Magazine Heroines on the Beach"}], "member-favorites": 458, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/62537.jpg?s=cf64254e428d770a9c5fb730468aa251", "link": "/anime/20649/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi_OVA", "name": "Kimi no Iru Machi OVA"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/83735.jpg?s=e89103ffc2b035e0c66e77cf91a10593", "link": "/anime/33743/Fuuka", "name": "Fuuka"}], "name-japanese": "(\u79cb\u6708 \u98a8\u590f)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/42458v.jpg", "link": "/people/9108/Ayaka_Shimizu", "name": "Shimizu, Ayaka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/44359v.jpg", "link": "/people/10929/Lynn", "name": "Lynn", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/43821v.jpg", "link": "/people/41966/Jill_Harris", "name": "Harris, Jill", "language": "English"}]}
