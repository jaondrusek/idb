{"about": "Birthday: July 26th\n Height: 150 cm\n Weight: 36 kg\n Age: 16\n Favorite Food: Mapo Tofu\n \n Tenshi has a variety of self-defense skills at her disposal, which she calls \"Guard Skills.\"\n \n <b>Hand Sonic:</b> Calls forth a blade on one hand or both. The blades are capable of slicing through steel. Kanade has shown several variations to its form:<ul><li><i>Version 1:</i> Regular shape, resembling a longsword.\n <li><i>Version 2:</i> A longer version than the previous, with a curved diamond shape on its tip.\n <li><i>Version 3:</i> Shaped like a traditional sai.\n <li><i>Version 4:</i> A variation which is shaped like a lotus flower with no edges other than, perhaps, its petals. Apparently more of a bludgeoning weapon than a slicing one. Tenshi admits to have created it in her attempt to make her weapon \"cuter.\"\n <li><i>Version 5:</i>Kanade&#039;s most recent variation of Hand Sonic. Is basically a pair of pincers secured on the arm by a blue gauntlet-like accessory. She created this version out of Otonashi&#039;s advice to make a more ruthless image.</ul><b>Distortion:</b> Distorts the path of bullets or any other projectiles around or away from her body.\n \n <b>Delay:</b> Creates a sort of after-image for close range. It is effective in dodging melee attacks by confusing the enemy into attacking elsewhere.\n \n <b>Harmonics:</b> Makes a clone of herself which is identical to her except the clone has blood-red eyes. Clones created through this ability have their own consciousness and have all the abilities of the original - including Harmonics itself. This ability is apparently sightly glitched, as her clones were shown to rebel against her to the extent of almost killing her.\n \n <b>Absorb:</b> A \"hidden ability\" which acts as the reverse of Harmonics. It allows the reintegration of clones created through Harmonics into the original&#039;s body. This, however, poses some risks as Harmonics clones also possess their own consciousness. This ability is connected to Harmonics using a command called timewait, which is simply a wait command which delays the execution of this ability. This command was created by Yuri as method of dealing with the Harmonics clones.\n \n <b>Overdrive:</b> A passive ability that gives her superhuman strength.\n \n <b>Howling:</b> Emits powerful high-frequency, high-amplitude sound-waves from crossed Hand Sonic blades, meant to make an enemy faint. Created by one of the Harmonics clones.\n \n <b>Angel Wings:</b> Sprouts wings from her back that can be used to slow descent and let her survive drops such as jumping from the roof of a building. Purely decorational, as she could survive the drop easily to begin with.\n \n <b>Energy Blast:</b> This unnamed technique produces a blue explosion that is shot out of her back in a vaguely angel wing-shaped blast. It was stated to be as powerful as a bomb by Naoi, after it demolished a mass of Shadows.\n Tenshi is the nickname the SSS gives her based on Yuri&#039;s belief that she must be a representative of god. Tenshi is one of the two main female characters of the anime. Her name means \"Angel,\" though she has stated she isn&#039;t one. The main plot of the anime revolves around her rivalry with Yuri, as Tenshi is believed to be the enemy of the Afterlife.\n \n She never admits her name as \"Angel.\" Instead, she calls herself the Student Council President of the school, who oversees the process of the afterlife.\n \n  During her last dialogue with Otonashi, she admits that Otonashi was her donor and that her heart is Otonashi&#039;s. After the credits, there is a short scene featuring what is assumed to be her and Otonashi possibly reuniting in the real world.\n\n", "name": "Kanade Tachibana", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/289337.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/176840.jpg?s=38d68bed2e0817bd8ef5b2f1180c3489", "link": "/manga/16648/Angel_Beats__Track_Zero", "name": "Angel Beats!: Track Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/153985.jpg?s=59e255c7f3e6d0fc4f0b523386d77396", "link": "/manga/19671/Angel_Beats__Heavens_Door", "name": "Angel Beats!: Heaven's Door"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/176837.jpg?s=0b541ede54348acfe2e96e41aed892a5", "link": "/manga/19672/Angel_Beats_The_4-koma__Bokura_no_Sensen_Koushinkyoku\u266a", "name": "Angel Beats!
