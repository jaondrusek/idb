{"about": "Dent is one of the three gym leaders of Striaton City. He is the brother of Pod and Corn, his fellow gym leaders. He is recognized as an A-rank Pokemon Sommelier, a person who has the ability to check the compatibility and closeness between a trainer and his/her Pokemon. After being defeated by Ash in a gym battle he decided to join Ash through his journey in the Unova Region. He is the group&#039;s navigator and cook.\n \n Dent has a love for playing detective and trains. He enjoys solving mysteries with scientific explanations, and he is a huge fan of Nimbasa City&#039;s subway system. He dislikes the Pokemon Purrloin, saying he had a bad experience with one in the past, but refuses to talk about it.\n \n Dent&#039;s vintage Pokemon is his Pansage. He has also acquired a Dwebble, which has evolved into a Crustle, and a Stunfisk while traveling.\n\n", "name": "Dent ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/102325.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 64, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/26135.jpg?s=8ed1ed307614ac37abcc769f0dd3c6a8", "link": "/anime/9107/Pokemon_Best_Wishes", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/29620.jpg?s=a85f893b345c4516f5a219815caaed1a", "link": "/anime/9917/Pokemon_Best_Wishes__Victini_to_Kuroki_Eiyuu_Zekrom", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!: Victini to Kuroki Eiyuu Zekrom"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/29621.jpg?s=624706d4940870af10e591b81132fbca", "link": "/anime/10740/Pokemon_Best_Wishes__Victini_to_Shiroki_Eiyuu_Reshiram", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!: Victini to Shiroki Eiyuu Reshiram"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/38311.jpg?s=d433a235351fe2905b44ac27eeedbb23", "link": "/anime/12671/Pokemon_Best_Wishes_Season_2__Kyurem_vs_Seikenshi", "name": "Pokemon Best Wishes!
