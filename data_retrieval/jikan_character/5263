{"about": "She is the newest member of the Debris Section. She is the adopted daughter of a death metal band leader turned engineer and an elementary school teacher. Tanabe did not speak until she was three years old. She is bright and earnest, but mostly unsure of herself. As a newcomer to space, the Debris Section and to extra-vehicular activity all at the same time, she has to slowly learn the ropes from everyone else. She believes that love, or \"ai\" (possibly a pun intended on her name being the Japanese word for love) is the solution to every problem. Kind and sweet, she is willing to do almost anything to help others. However, her kind spirit also masks a drive to become better than she is.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Ai Tanabe", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/14/53937.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/170572.jpg?s=86f060ee48a190d1ec3c19ac090083cf", "link": "/manga/481/Planetes", "name": "Planetes"}], "member-favorites": 285, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/50463.jpg?s=145e9711d3a1a1cbff96e6d94297a34e", "link": "/anime/329/Planetes", "name": "Planetes"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/29571.jpg?s=10ae2c02e2c760423ce2c46797086ac2", "link": "/anime/10735/Planetes_Picture_Drama", "name": "Planetes Picture Drama"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7530\u540d\u90e8\u611b)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/18113v.jpg", "link": "/people/3/Satsuki_Yukino", "name": "Yukino, Satsuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39079v.jpg", "link": "/people/69/Julie_Ann_Taylor", "name": "Taylor, Julie Ann", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15553v.jpg", "link": "/people/1088/Debora_Magnaghi", "name": "Magnaghi, Debora", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/32319v.jpg", "link": "/people/7302/Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique_Marlot", "name": "Marlot, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/8042v.jpg", "link": "/people/10011/Anne_Helm", "name": "Helm, Anne", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/24881v.jpg", "link": "/people/21669/Carmen_Calvell", "name": "Calvell, Carmen", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/48355v.jpg", "link": "/people/45006/Jill_Schulz", "name": "Schulz, Jill", "language": "German"}]}
