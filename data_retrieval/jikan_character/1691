{"about": "<b>Age:</b> Appears to be about 20 to 24 years old\n <b>Blood Type:</b> AB\n <b>Height</b>: 184cm\n \n A mysterious young man who has absolutely no memory of his past or the nature of his being. His only clues are two names: \"Tooya\" (\"ten nights\", his own name) and \"Mikage.\" He was found and hired by Kagami and works for Mikage International, and later rebels against them. He and Aya are drawn to one another, not only in love.\n \n Tooya is the embodiment/offspring of the hagoromo which Ceres is searching for. As he regains his lost memories, he sacrifices the immortality bestowed upon him by the object to save Aya and his unborn child. At the end of the series, he tells Yuuhi that he may not live for long and that Yuuhi should take care of Aya once he dies.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Tooya ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/89852.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/160959.jpg?s=b25a40fba41cdf17de9551957d661847", "link": "/manga/83/Ayashi_no_Ceres", "name": "Ayashi no Ceres"}], "member-favorites": 224, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/23580.jpg?s=1c5dad5f91553fdea7bce09d1858dfb4", "link": "/anime/104/Ayashi_no_Ceres", "name": "Ayashi no Ceres"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5341\u591c)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42160v.jpg", "link": "/people/20/Katsuyuki_Konishi", "name": "Konishi, Katsuyuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/3397v.jpg", "link": "/people/6499/Yeong_Seon_Kim", "name": "Kim, Yeong Seon", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/4734v.jpg", "link": "/people/7603/Alessandro_Quarta", "name": "Quarta, Alessandro", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42500v.jpg", "link": "/people/11560/Victor_Atelevich", "name": "Atelevich, Victor", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/18885/\u00d3scar_Redondo", "name": "Redondo, \u00d3scar", "language": "Spanish"}]}
