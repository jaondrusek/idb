{"about": "Born: November 30, 1980 \n Height: 158 cm \n Weight: 46 kg \n Family: Mother (Natsuko), Father, Older sister (Nao) and younger sister (Nami).\n \n Komatsu came to Tokyo, looking to find her dream. Unlike Osaki, Komatsu came from a large and happy household, though her childish outlook prevented her from living on her own initially. She&#039;s the middle child of three sisters.\n \n Her chance encounter with Osaki began a friendship which changes Komatsu&#039;s life forever. She is introduced to Osaki&#039;s band, Black Stones, and their members. She later even helps \"Blast\" to find their bassist, by drawing a poster to advertise the vacancy. Much to her surprise, she also discovers that the members of Blast were friends with the members of Trapnest, a popular rock band of which she&#039;s a very big fan.\n \n Nana Komatsu discovers she is pregnant (revealed in chapters 25 and 26), and although she really loves Nobuo, she realizes that Takumi would be in a better position to care for her and her unborn child. She also chooses to be with Takumi because she knows that the only way Nobu would be able to care for it would be to give up playing with Blast and return to his family&#039;s inn. She doesn&#039;t want him to give up his dream, plus she wants Blast to become famous and popular more than anything. Nana K. clings to Takumi&#039;s calm attitude towards her pregnancy, and she is given strength through his kindness at that time.\n \n Because of her pregnancy, she marries Takumi (initially in name only, for Takumi delayed their wedding because of Osaki&#039;s engagement to Ren). Her married name throughout the series is Nana Ichinose. As the time passes, she realizes she loves Takumi. Takumi&#039;s compliments on her cooking when they first met encourages her to improve her cooking even more and take cooking classes. She makes breakfast for Takumi everyday and draws a funny face on it with ketchup, usually stating her mood to Takumi. They both seem to have a mundane married relationship, with quarrels and making up due to her naive and forgiving nature and Takumi&#039;s forgetful nonchalant nature. She hopes that she will be able to live happily, although in the future sequences of NANA she lives in Japan while he lives in London, England.\n (Source: Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Nana Komatsu", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/88130.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/163191.jpg?s=1b4710b799f4d19f3530d0e05c4e3087", "link": "/manga/28/Nana", "name": "Nana"}], "member-favorites": 1288, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/11232.jpg?s=756a35e292f249137df1e21cd4c2072d", "link": "/anime/877/Nana", "name": "Nana"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5c0f\u677e \u5948\u3005)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/199v.jpg", "link": "/people/249/Midori_Kawana", "name": "Kawana, Midori", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/39471v.jpg", "link": "/people/643/Kelly_Sheridan", "name": "Sheridan, Kelly", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/811v.jpg", "link": "/people/767/Federica_De_Bortoli", "name": "De Bortoli, Federica", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/2643v.jpg", "link": "/people/5999/Pascale_Chemin", "name": "Chemin, Pascale", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/4272v.jpg", "link": "/people/7326/Nuria_Trifol", "name": "Trifol, Nuria", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/5057v.jpg", "link": "/people/7802/Kitty_Mezei", "name": "Mezei, Kitty", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/25851v.jpg", "link": "/people/8812/Mi_Sook_Jeong", "name": "Jeong, Mi Sook", "language": "Korean"}]}
