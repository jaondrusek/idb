{"about": "Hatori, also known as Tori, is 28 years old and an editor in the Emerald department. Although in the beginning he is serious and reserved, we later learn that he has harbored both deep and secret feelings for his childhood friend Chiaki. After kissing him and confessing his love, Hatori pulls away fearing that Chiaki doesn't feel the same, but instead loves his rival, Yanase. Although Chiaki does somewhat have the same feelings, unbeknownst to Tori. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n", "name": "Yoshiyuki Hatori", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/134459.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/14369.jpg?s=e251f4583ed9927114090babbfcca515", "link": "/manga/10573/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Onodera_Ritsu_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Onodera Ritsu no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/44313.jpg?s=e47b99a4ad9f5ee49d20b983dfa22ece", "link": "/manga/26224/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yoshino_Chiaki_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yoshino Chiaki no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/81400.jpg?s=49f8ab1e46a83b091cc97d7b1632eef2", "link": "/manga/31105/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}], "member-favorites": 92, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/35863.jpg?s=79e32a75581f0b42777ff50ec311cec2", "link": "/anime/8063/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_OVA", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi OVA"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/29763.jpg?s=62c940272d145be1beb8cc2e524c1fc8", "link": "/anime/9926/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/34871.jpg?s=4446ddce68f9b3002d41525c5482aaa1", "link": "/anime/11123/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_2", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/65927.jpg?s=9e47a5b2c7f469e9990a4ca5f202ae8a", "link": "/anime/20371/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi_Movie__Yokozawa_Takafumi_no_Baai", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi Movie: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/55723.jpg?s=caa44a790ff16b409b6f3b008d957782", "link": "/anime/20815/Sekaiichi_Hatsukoi__Valentine-hen", "name": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Valentine-hen"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7fbd\u9ce5 \u82b3\u96ea)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42161v.jpg", "link": "/people/513/Yuuichi_Nakamura", "name": "Nakamura, Yuuichi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
