Chihaya's childhood friend is quite the golden boy. Smart, good looking, and mature, he excells at nearly everything he does which makes him the voice of reason in the Misusawa Karuta Club. While he sees himself as keeper of Chihaya and the less experienced members, he demands a lot of himself both in games and as a leader and can overthink even the most simple situations. Taichi's karuta leverages his incredible memory to give him a sense of which cards might be called next and the ability to out-think opponents. He also has a crush on Chihaya but is hesitant to do anything as he thinks that she only has eyes for Arata.\n \n Favourite Song: Poem #16\n Though we are parted,\n If on Mount Inaba's peak\n I should hear the sound\n Of the pine trees growing there,\n I'll come back again to you.\n\n", "name": "Taichi Mashima", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/239401.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/135341.jpg?s=3357fd106fb7b271f923ed02f3dbd28a", "link": "/manga/13245/Chihayafuru", "name": "Chihayafuru"}], "member-favorites": 1292, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/35749.jpg?s=8a740972ed1b2fb936455b857db0ec23", "link": "/anime/10800/Chihayafuru", "name": "Chihayafuru"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/47435.jpg?s=d87309cb31b7eead6f1bebfd2696576b", "link": "/anime/14397/Chihayafuru_2", "name": "Chihayafuru 2"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/54451.jpg?s=bd9dd4f9015dc00ae28315c22e6eec7e", "link": "/anime/18745/Chihayafuru_2__Waga_Mi_Yo_ni_Furu_Nagame_Seshi_Ma_ni", "name": "Chihayafuru 2: Waga Mi Yo ni Furu Nagame Seshi Ma ni"}], "name-japanese": "(\u771f\u5cf6 \u592a\u4e00)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42141v.jpg", "link": "/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano", "name": "Miyano, Mamoru", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/12696v.jpg", "link": "/people/823/Ayahi_Takagaki", "name": "Takagaki, Ayahi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/20007v.jpg", "link": "/people/17243/Adam_Gibbs", "name": "Gibbs, Adam", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/30729v.jpg", "link": "/people/29571/Chelsea_Ryan_McCurdy", "name": "McCurdy, Chelsea Ryan", "language": "English"}]}
