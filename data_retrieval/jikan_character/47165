The grandchild of a master karuta player, Arata inspires Chihaya to take up karuta by telling her that he thinks she has a talent for it. He had difficulty fitting in at Chihaya's elementary school because of his Fukui dialect and his family's poverty. His passion for karuta is inspired by his grandfather, a Meijin (master). After their first game at Arata's house, Chihaya befriends him.
