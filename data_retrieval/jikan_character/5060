{"about": "A wind spirit from Elfhelm, a utopia on the island Skellig in the Western Sea. Elves in Berserk can only be seen by the open-minded; the devoutly religious cannot see Puck at all, though he can play with their face unbeknownst to them. Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his \"Bloody Needle\" attack, tossing a spiny object resembling a seed pod at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count.\n \n Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Puck ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/101984.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157931.jpg?s=3bdf7679c4b20db245f213794d76a680", "link": "/manga/2/Berserk", "name": "Berserk"}], "member-favorites": 380, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/37193.jpg?s=80f07ba3931586a9cb3acafbbe051292", "link": "/anime/12113/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_II_-_Doldrey_Kouryaku", "name": "Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen II - Doldrey Kouryaku"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/41305.jpg?s=29e37c0b05d4a50dc02671103f607dfd", "link": "/anime/12115/Berserk__Ougon_Jidai-hen_III_-_Kourin", "name": "Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen III - Kourin"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/79352.jpg?s=5beb16fc8972e27b10e72586f38ab269", "link": "/anime/32379/Berserk", "name": "Berserk"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/85296.jpg?s=f5beaa71813a19b445c727578054d6bf", "link": "/anime/34055/Berserk_2nd_Season", "name": "Berserk 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/86045.jpg?s=ee0a002520c5f2d5076a268ebfb05fb0", "link": "/anime/35676/Berserk__Majo_no_Tsuisou", "name": "Berserk: Majo no Tsuisou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d1\u30c3\u30af)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/12063v.jpg", "link": "/people/579/Kaoru_Mizuhara", "name": "Mizuhara, Kaoru", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/20265v.jpg", "link": "/people/14285/Sarah_Williams", "name": "Williams, Sarah", "language": "English"}]}
