Along with her four friends, they created an animation titled \"Shinbutsu Konkou SHICHIFUKUJIN\", which was to be shown at their high school&#039;s cultural festival. During production, everyone played their roles in order to complete the project. However, it is revealed that Aoi is not the greatest at drawing, computer graphics, script writing, or voice acting. Before graduation, the girls made a promise to reunite one day and create another anime altogether. They set this creed in stone by sharing donuts. It seems that everyone has their minds set on what they want to pursue in the anime industry. As for Aoi, she graduated without a specific goal in mind, and came to Musashino Animation to work as a production assistant, immediately getting involved in her first anime, Exodus!\n \n After her first year as a production assistant at Musashino Animation , the company is hired to work on an anime adaptation for a manga titled \"The Third Girl Aerials Squad.\" At this time, Aoi is promoted by director Seiichi Kinoshita to her new position as Head Production Assistant after her colleague, Yutaka Honda, resigned from the company to pursue his dreams.
