{"about": "Birthdate: June 18\n Age: 16\n Height: 189 cm (6&#039; 2\")\n Weight: 77 kg (170 lbs)\n Blood type: A\n Star-sign: Gemini\n School: Teiko (formerly), Kaij\u014d High (currently)\n Number: #8 (Teiko), #7 (Kaij\u014d)\n Position: Small Forward\n Talent: Copy, Perfect Copy\n Mott\u014d: \"Be honest with yourself\"\n Hobbies: Karaoke\n \n Now a freshman at Kaijou High, Kise was the rookie of the \"Generation of Miracles.\" Since he only started playing basketball in his second year of middle school, Kise was his team&#039;s least experienced member, and notes himself the weakest of the five. Kise&#039;s unique skill is his ability to mimic the moves and plays of other players. The only moves he cannot copy are the special skills of truly exceptional players, like the other members of the \"Generation of Miracles.\" Beyond being a strong player in his own right, Kise respects Kuroko&#039;s abilities and wishes to play with him once again. He seems to have a slight obsession with Kuroko, believing that they were the two who got along most in middle school (though Kuroko said they didn&#039;t) and often blurting out random facts about him (mentioning that Kuroko was an Aquarius, even though Kasamatsu was talking about Midorima).\n \n Also, he&#039;s a model in his free time, so girls are always mobbing him.\n \n He has two older sisters who got him into modeling at the first place.\n \n Later on in the manga series, it&#039;s revealed that Kise had developed the strength to mimic the other Generation of Miracles&#039; member&#039;s play (shown as Midorima&#039;s absolute accuracy, Aomine&#039;s flexibility, and also Murasakibara&#039;s monstrous strength), which resulted from his hard work these past days. And also because the technique costs lots of energy even from the original user, Kise can only use them for 5 minutes during a match.\n\n", "name": "Ryouta Kise", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/246753.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/92071.jpg?s=e573748187bb17c86a81be7d64091d14", "link": "/manga/11652/Kuroko_no_Basket", "name": "Kuroko no Basket"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/164178.jpg?s=295de5bba419caab32516c35ac9130e5", "link": "/manga/42737/Kuroko_no_Basket__Replace", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Replace"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/163711.jpg?s=cb274337cf4575ba63f803625f9cdf12", "link": "/manga/83807/Kuroko_no_Basket__Extra_Game", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Extra Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157861.jpg?s=ac345287600280871dd098f62341253d", "link": "/manga/85900/Kuroko_no_Basket__Replace_Plus", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Replace Plus"}], "member-favorites": 3042, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/50453.jpg?s=9aac7027b3020e88dc8de37232e6e7db", "link": "/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket", "name": "Kuroko no Basket"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/42751.jpg?s=02ad88eb23c1bc096dfb336a531f0b42", "link": "/anime/15487/Kuroko_no_Basket_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/56155.jpg?s=97eb6f6c896fb3453db1a72a3b6b3f2b", "link": "/anime/16894/Kuroko_no_Basket_2nd_Season", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/76803.jpg?s=2f25c9bad67018a87d4f3b8496c57bc2", "link": "/anime/16916/Kuroko_no_Basket__Tip_Off", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Tip Off"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/46071.jpg?s=5bb152ebfc46f88532dfd5434897682c", "link": "/anime/17259/Kuroko_no_Basket__Oshaberi_Shiyokka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Shiyokka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/55501.jpg?s=9943233d2a7b634b1e44a6fe337faff7", "link": "/anime/19669/Kuroko_no_Basket__Baka_ja_Katenai_no_yo", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Baka ja Katenai no yo!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/68055.jpg?s=325816175aec01ae07e239969e2e64d6", "link": "/anime/22125/Kuroko_no_Basket__Mou_Ikkai_Yarimasen_ka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Mou Ikkai Yarimasen ka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/59027.jpg?s=59140b951b45c2ba1676f938d1f18049", "link": "/anime/22673/Kuroko_no_Basket_2nd_Season_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/68299.jpg?s=0acd76b0c27676033c1d6189e0a38a30", "link": "/anime/24415/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/71175.jpg?s=d797bee63686521f3da7f6b303c8560a", "link": "/anime/29583/Kuroko_no_Basket__Oshaberi_Demo_Shimasen_ka", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Demo Shimasen ka"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/72551.jpg?s=6b435b365b5a62c2c3c0c71e9f9152b9", "link": "/anime/30311/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season_NG-shuu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season NG-shuu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/77323.jpg?s=10025b6d6b660f3dc42adc50424d7124", "link": "/anime/31051/Kuroko_no_Basket__Saikou_no_Present_Desu", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Saikou no Present Desu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/83106.jpg?s=58165246a17340e3a2b17e28ede3e3e9", "link": "/anime/31658/Kuroko_no_Basket__Last_Game", "name": "Kuroko no Basket: Last Game"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/82691.jpg?s=59b5404fafc5c0c0fbda300c9ea6b0c3", "link": "/anime/32869/Kuroko_no_Basket_Movie_1__Winter_Cup_-_Kage_to_Hikari", "name": "Kuroko no Basket Movie 1: Winter Cup -
