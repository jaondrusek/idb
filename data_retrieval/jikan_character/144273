{"about": "A highly energetic vampire. She usually avoids biting other people&#039;s necks, instead drinking blood packs sent by the government, and using blood substitutes like tomato juice. Contrary to myths, she loves eating garlic. She occasionally has the urge to nibble on someone, usually her sister.
