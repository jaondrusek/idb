{"about": "An NPC from the open world RPG \"Avalken of Reminisce.\" She is an intellectual person who is silent and stoic and speaks in a slow, bland, and dry tone. However, she tries her best to be emotional, such as attempting to make puns to cheer others up, tough these puns are extremely bad. She is also a bit of a glutton, enjoying real world food. She is capable of flight as well as creating magical shields but lacks offensive abilities, relying on real world artillery to make up for her weakness. Her Creator, the planner of \"Avalken of Reminisce,\" is already deceased.\n \n In episode 13, an alternative, \"adult\" Meterora is presented as a gag and how Meteora perceives herself. This alternative version is voiced by Sayaka Ohara.\n (Source: Wikipedia, official site)\n\n", "name": "Meteora &Ouml;sterreich", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/322619.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/199589.jpg?s=e0e32ca02ec678efcf850b21e3620831", "link": "/manga/103727/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "member-favorites": 243, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/85469.jpg?s=5e186ab3cfff5f4da1c3c4dce4c74395", "link": "/anime/34561/Re_Creators", "name": "Re:Creators"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30e1\u30c6\u30aa\u30e9\u30fb\u30a8\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30d2)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42697v.jpg", "link": "/people/92/Sayaka_Ohara", "name": "Ohara, Sayaka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/36967v.jpg", "link": "/people/11297/Inori_Minase", "name": "Minase, Inori", "language": "Japanese"}]}
