{"about": "Gender: Male\n Alias: Grey Stoke\n Genetic Type: Newtype\n Era: Universal Century\n Status: Alive\n Birthdate: October 10, 0073\n Age: 14 [MSG-ZZ], 15 [Evolve], 62 [MSCB-SH], 79 [MSVG-SS]\n Hair: Brown\n Eye: Green\n Family: Leina Ashta (Sister)\n Love Interest(s): Roux Louka \n Nationality: Earth Federation (Side 1: Shangri-La)\n Affiliation: Anti Earth Union Group, Gundam Team\n Occupation: Junk Dealer, Mobile Suit pilot\n Rank: Ensign\n \n At the start of the series, Judau and his friends are poor junk dealers at the space colony of Shangri-La in Side 1. Judau is rather loudmouthed and straightfoward, but has a good heart and displays powerful Newtype abilities. He has a younger sister named Leina whom he cares very deeply for. Their parents moved to another colony to find work and they send money back to them.\n \n While scavenging for junk one day, Judau comes across the escape pod of Titans pilot Yazan Gable, who managed to survive the Gryps Conflict that concluded Zeta Gundam. Discovering that the Argama was in port at the same colony, Yazan forcefully brings Judau and his friends along to help attack the ship. Judau breaks free from Yazan in order to steal the Zeta Gundam and sell it. He and his friends attempt this numerous times but fail, usually ending up saving the Argama instead from Yazan or Neo Zeon troops. They ultimately befriend the crew and join the AEUG, where they become known as the \"Gundam Team,\" with Judau piloting the Zeta Gundam.\n \n Judau's mission eventually becomes personal when the Neo Zeon kidnap Leina. He often goes into battle against orders since he is so desperate to save his sister. Strangely, Neo Zeon leader Haman Karn becomes fascinated with Judau and has a possible romantic interest in him. Although they are enemies, she always offers Judau - who is a Newtype like herself - a chance to join her side, which Judau always refuses. Artificial Newtype and Neo Zeon pilot Elpeo Puru also has a romantic crush on Judau.\n \n Eventually, Judau receives the Double Zeta Gundam (ZZ Gundam) from Anaheim Electronics and becomes its pilot. \n \n \n He almost loses his resolve to fight when it appears that Leina has been killed, however, he senses that she is alive and continues piloting, despite everyone thinking that he has lost his mind. In the climactic Battle of Axis, Judau defeats Haman in a one-on-one Mobile Suit battle. Haman kills herself, wondering how a person like Judau can be so good. Judau is reunited with Leina, who was alive after all thanks to Sayla Mass. He, Leina and fellow pilot Roux Louka quit the AEUG and head to the planet Jupiter to start a new life. \n \n He reappears as an old man, going under the name \"Grey Stoke\" in the manga Crossbone Gundam Skullheart in which he helps the protagonist Tobia Arronax. His Mobile Suit, the Gump, bears striking similarities in overall appearance to Judau's old MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam.\n \n Twenty years later, Grey appears again, alongside V Gundam protagonist Uso Evin, in the manga side-story of V Gundam. It is in this side-story, in which Grey is shown to have somehow acquired an intact, black LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam, that another interesting fact is revealed: Concealed underneath the Gump's odd-looking cylindrical \"head\" is its true head: That of the MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam\n \n Judau was also the central character of the non-canon crossover manga with Space Runaway Ideon, Mobile Suit Vs. Giant God: Gigantis' Counterattack, where the UC universe is in fact the universe Ideon remade at the end of the apocalyptic movie conclusion and Judau is said to be the reincarnation of Ideon protagonist Cosmo Yuki.\n \n (Source: The Gundam Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Judau Ashta", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/58566.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/72047.jpg?s=270c04d7eff5bab59dfd5a6cf1443e8b", "link": "/manga/16168/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_ZZ", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/72045.jpg?s=68047336bd8b64865916c2f675efa68c", "link": "/manga/28007/Kidou_Senshi_vs_Densetsu_Kyojin__Gyakushuu_no_Gigantis", "name": "Kidou Senshi vs Densetsu Kyojin: Gyakushuu no Gigantis"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/58661.jpg?s=3147b44745c395486af783da0567de00", "link": "/manga/31939/Mobile_Suit_Victory_Gundam_Side_Story", "name": "Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Side Story"}], "member-favorites": 56, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/4636.jpg?s=cbbe5a52235d1f3158c885db9ed0c5aa", "link": "/anime/86/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_ZZ", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/51035.jpg?s=3d326d240696fc88d96bfa75107707ce", "link": "/anime/2302/Mobile_Suit_SD_Gundam_Mk_I", "name": "Mobile Suit SD Gundam Mk I"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/55903.jpg?s=2a333b26be4d125c0f68711d58ba6dc9", "link": "/anime/2303/Mobile_Suit_SD_Gundam_Mk_II", "name": "Mobile Suit SD Gundam Mk II"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/2546.jpg?s=4a70f58929f48f240708ea0081603464", "link": "/anime/2306/Mobile_Suit_SD_Gundams_Counterattack", "name": "Mobile Suit SD Gundam's Counterattack"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/28142.jpg?s=3f2273d3284823c8253b535c62fe8c3b", "link": "/anime/3288/Gundam_Evolve", "name": "Gundam Evolve"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b8\u30e5\u30c9\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30b7\u30bf)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/34103v.jpg", "link": "/people/131/Kazuki_Yao", "name": "Yao, Kazuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/16181v.jpg", "link": "/people/10754/Darren_Pleavin", "name": "Pleavin, Darren", "language": "English"}]}
