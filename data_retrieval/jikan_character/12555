{"about": "Aries Shion is a fictional character from the manga series, Saint Seiya, authored by Masami Kurumada, later adapted to anime.\n \n Shion is the original Grand Pope of Sanctuary, as well as one of the remaining survivors of the Holy War from the 1800s. He also served as the master of Aries Mu, who would eventually inherit the Gold Cloth of Aries from him.\n \n Shion is one of last survivors of the race that inhabited the lost continent Lemuria (also called Mu). Due to this, he has a life span much larger than that of a normal human, what allowed him to live more than two hundred years.\n \n He is a close friend of Libra Dohko, the only survivor of the last generation of saints together with Shion, and the master of Aries Mu. \n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Shion Aries", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/238303.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/155914.jpg?s=0998cefcd21b89fa39f9810826c811fc", "link": "/manga/1045/Saint_Seiya", "name": "Saint Seiya"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/163126.jpg?s=c60e699264cceec96b6cb2094d483b43", "link": "/manga/1047/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/163134.jpg?s=2eca18b922ab28f57f9bf1fb7800f9ff", "link": "/manga/1322/Saint_Seiya__Next_Dimension_-_Meiou_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Meiou Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/129599.jpg?s=da99e2fcd406ee6d2577893e983580b4", "link": "/manga/25916/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa_Gaiden", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa Gaiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/187408.jpg?s=6b3cb9b837deaa9731b28c1f4e99c302", "link": "/manga/67297/Saint_Seiya_Episode_G__Assassin", "name": "Saint Seiya Episode G: Assassin"}], "member-favorites": 56, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/28496.jpg?s=682f15281bc191e9f9d41451434e2cf1", "link": "/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya", "name": "Saint Seiya"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/16343.jpg?s=84d5c553bf9d9e9831c7c60a0e7fa665", "link": "/anime/1257/Saint_Seiya__Meiou_Hades_Juuni_Kyuu-hen", "name": "Saint Seiya: Meiou Hades Juuni Kyuu-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/5952.jpg?s=4df12e239e55860746eee126da60fc55", "link": "/anime/1259/Saint_Seiya__Tenkai-hen_Josou_-_Overture", "name": "Saint Seiya: Tenkai-hen Josou - Overture"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/13518.jpg?s=90270659b829c187416dca87630f72e2", "link": "/anime/6154/Saint_Seiya__The_Hades_Chapter_Sanctuary_-_Yomigaerishi_Gold_Saint-tachi_no_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter Sanctuary - Yomigaerishi Gold Saint-tachi no Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/75546.jpg?s=a532cddc9e84b080f4e0aecbde9330ab", "link": "/anime/6171/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/29597.jpg?s=9a6b38060967686f8277fd764633375a", "link": "/anime/9130/Saint_Seiya__The_Lost_Canvas_-_Meiou_Shinwa_2", "name": "Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas - Meiou Shinwa 2"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7261\u7f8a\u5ea7\u306e\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42613v.jpg", "link": "/people/22/Shinichiro_Miki", "name": "Miki, Shinichiro", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/25253v.jpg", "link": "/people/157/Nobuo_Tobita", "name": "Tobita, Nobuo", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/49695v.jpg", "link": "/people/234/Hideyuki_Tanaka", "name": "Tanaka, Hideyuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/1236v.jpg", "link": "/people/1232/Alessandro_DErrico", "name": "D'Errico, Alessandro", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/34423v.jpg", "link": "/people/11455/Walter_Breda", "name": "Breda, Walter", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/20827v.jpg", "link": "/people/18367/Luis_Daniel_Ramirez", "name": "Ramirez, Luis Daniel", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/32519v.jpg", "link": "/people/20082/Ruggero_Andreozzi", "name": "Andreozzi, Ruggero", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/23062v.jpg", "link": "/people/20334/Carlos_Di_Blasi", "name": "Di Blasi, Carlos", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/28763v.jpg", "link": "/people/25611/Arnaud_L\u00e9onard", "name": "L\u00e9onard, Arnaud", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42494v.jpg", "link": "/people/28299/Luiz_Laffey", "name": "Laffey, Luiz", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/31997v.jpg", "link": "/people/30759/Rafael_Rivera", "name": "Rivera, Rafael", "language": "Spanish"}]}
