{"about": "Kusakabe has naturally curly golden hair and droopy eyes. He plays guitar and was in a band until they split up later in high school. He doesn&#039;t excel at anything school related, but is good with music. He loves UK rock songs and old J-pop. In secret he rigorously trains his cooking skills. Born in the beginning of summer, he is the second child, the first being his older sister whom he gets along with very well. He later gets his motorcycle license and hopes to get a job in the music field.\n\n", "name": "Hikaru Kusakabe", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/92105.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/12994.jpg?s=fcde9fe930ba54d531669abce2967075", "link": "/manga/9699/Doukyuusei", "name": "Doukyuusei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/27839.jpg?s=f08af8ca8a28729e0b85984b0e5d245b", "link": "/manga/18200/Sotsugyousei", "name": "Sotsugyousei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/67873.jpg?s=f69440cec3c9c915bd3b0c539ed638b6", "link": "/manga/19570/Sora_to_Hara", "name": "Sora to Hara"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/114943.jpg?s=f03f4ab1858b2d8f00249e1528f877f2", "link": "/manga/39565/OB", "name": "O.B."}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/178382.jpg?s=7b51735c51bfc88a19e140d2e4076f99", "link": "/manga/98841/Dousoukai", "name": "Dousoukai"}], "member-favorites": 217, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/78606.jpg?s=1a22441ea12706fa69c1c691a7bd9a5e", "link": "/anime/30346/Doukyuusei_Movie", "name": "Doukyuusei (Movie)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8349\u58c1 \u5149)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44026v.jpg", "link": "/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya", "name": "Kamiya, Hiroshi", "language": "Japanese"}]}
