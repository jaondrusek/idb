{"about": "Birthday: April 28\n Height: 180 cm\n Weight: 65 kg\n Chest: 84 cm\n Blood type: O\n Specialty: Super High School-Level Luck\n \n Nagito has the title of Super High School-Level Luck. However, his luck resembles a curse disguised as a gift, as it&#039;s a constant turn between extreme &#039;good luck&#039; and extreme &#039;bad luck&#039;.\n \n Nagito first comes off a polite, meek and kind yet somewhat insecure boy. He attempts to be the team&#039;s conflict mediator and optimistic poster boy, often encouraging others to be hopeful and cooperate, but he isn&#039;t really taken seriously and is even made fun of by Hiyoko Saionji who considers his dramatic pep talks about hope and friendship embarrassing and lame. Nagito often appears unusually carefree, though he claims to be a pessimist. He seems to lack tact and can sometimes say things that seem awkward, strange or even unsettling, though he doesn&#039;t seem to realize this and acts like it&#039;s just normal casual talk. Despite this, he appears harmless, and Hajime Hinata even mentions that his bright smile is very comforting. He is generally quite submissive and a push-over with a self-depreciating attitude. He wants to avoid conflict and goes along with other people (even agreeing with Hiyoko when she makes fun of him), but at times he can also be more forceful. He is quick to scold Hajime when he&#039;s being too pessimistic or when he thought he was bullying Mikan Tsumiki. He is notably annoyed by Teruteru Hanamura&#039;s treatment of girls and decides to keep an eye on him to make sure he won&#039;t harass anyone. He is also the only one to stay with unconscious Hajime and expresses concern for his physical and mental well-being, even after Hajime told him to go away. Though friendly with everyone, he is mostly interested in spending time with Hajime and can even appear a bit clingy towards him. Hajime considers him a little annoying and maybe not the most reliable, but still a kind person.\n \n Nagito appears in Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls referred to only as \"Servant\".\n \n Nagito shows his true colors during the first trial as he is revealed to be obsessed with a twisted idea of \"absolute hope\". For him, hope is the absolute good and any deed done in the name of hope is okay, even killing. He believes that the world naturally includes constant clashes between two or more hopes and the \"strong hope\" will devour \"weak hope\" in means to live and survive (adoringly, he calls this process \"poetry in motion\"). In his opinion, the ordinary people, despair and weak hope are just stepladders for creating stronger hope and he has aversion for these things while simultaneously considering them necessary. He believes that the talented Ultimates are special kind of people by birth, capable of strengthening their own hopes by facing and beating despair (instead of being broken by it like weak, ordinary people), to the point of embodying hope and creating absolute hope that can overcome any despair. Like Hope&#039;s Peak Academy in general, Nagito strongly associates hope with talent and talent with worth.\n \n After discovering the horrible truth behind the Neo World Program, Nagito sacrificed himself in order to kill the Remnants of Despair. He set up a \"suicide\" to cause Chiaki Nanami, the traitor and not a Remnant of Despair, to unknowingly deal the killing blow, and therefore become the blackened. However, the remaining students discovered his plan, and Monokuma executed Chiaki instead.\n (Source: Danganronpa Wiki, edited)\n\n", "name": "Nagito Komaeda", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/309480.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/123439.jpg?s=22ddbc8a3a4792ce8192d2abc3471383", "link": "/manga/44229/Super_Danganronpa_2__Nanami_Chiaki_no_Sayonara_Zetsubou_Daibouken", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Nanami Chiaki no Sayonara Zetsubou Daibouken"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/78039.jpg?s=73a8770a8987cb0c0dff0aef2980f384", "link": "/manga/44243/Super_Danganronpa_2__Sayonara_Zetsubou_Gakuen_-_4-koma_KINGS", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Sayonara Zetsubou Gakuen - 4-koma KINGS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/184555.jpg?s=e1ffb2f47acd675c4b59f5c8adb6112c", "link": "/manga/48441/Super_Danganronpa_2__Chou_Koukou-kyuu_no_Kouun_to_Kibou_to_Zetsubou", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Chou Koukou-kyuu no Kouun to Kibou to Zetsubou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/179039.jpg?s=5d6248ee157522ba2770aafc7de10491", "link": "/manga/51575/Super_Danganronpa_2__Dangan_Island_Kokoro_Tokonatsu_Kokoronpa\u266a", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2: Dangan Island Kokoro Tokonatsu, Kokoronpa\u266a"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/167044.jpg?s=30f95d93a6d80d751c1aecbbeb70ea1b", "link": "/manga/89244/Zettai_Zetsubou_Shoujo__Danganronpa_Another_Episode", "name": "Zettai Zetsubou Shoujo: Danganronpa Another Episode"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/167796.jpg?s=a1a5334ba916dcf3d5c2cbb85cdcd68d", "link": "/manga/89245/Zettai_Zetsubou_Shoujo__Danganronpa_Another_Episode_-_Genocider_Mode", "name": "Zettai Zetsubou Shoujo: Danganronpa Another Episode - Genocider Mode"}], "member-favorites": 5030, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/80931.jpg?s=40886f3f5ef9ce1e20e95792a5b68224", "link": "/anime/32189/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Mirai-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80932.jpg?s=ef1bd8513699f5ef043857050438eb59", "link": "/anime/33028/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Zetsubou-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Zetsubou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/82068.jpg?s=767d8bd5e166716dac2e126fa0bec2a0", "link": "/anime/34103/Danganronpa_3__The_End_of_Kibougamine_Gakuen_-_Kibou-hen", "name": "Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Kibou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/83150.jpg?s=a50577a33718a07d15de2f293c8b7969", "link": "/anime/34152/Super_Danganronpa_25__Komaeda_Nagito_to_Sekai_no_Hakaimono", "name": "Super Danganronpa 2.5: Komaeda Nagito to Sekai no Hakaimono"}], "name-japanese": "(\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12105v.jpg", "link": "/people/287/Megumi_Ogata", "name": "Ogata, Megumi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/29853v.jpg", "link": "/people/732/Bryce_Papenbrook", "name": "Papenbrook, Bryce", "language": "English"}]}
