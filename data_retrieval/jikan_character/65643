{"about": "Koro-sensei is a teacher for class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School and the main antihero of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. He was responsible for carving out a large chunk of the moon to become a permanent crescent moon and plans to destroy the earth after teaching class 3-E for a year.\n \n His name comes from Korosenai (\u6bba\u305b\u306a\u3044) means \"cannot be killed\" and sensei, means teacher. Literally, his name means unkillable teacher.\n \n Koro-sensei is made up of anti-matter. He will inevitably die in March, whether the students assassinate him or not.\n \n It is later revealed that the chance of this happening was less than 1%.\n \n Koro-sensei was previously known as the \"God of Death.\"\n \n Koro-sensei did not actually destroy the moon, a rat infused with anti-matter did.\n\n", "name": "Koro-sensei ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/9/277325.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/90819.jpg?s=c661c13671ac6cbff3793e8817752ca9", "link": "/manga/39883/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/186156.jpg?s=b8be527db45bc41266b60a60be246837", "link": "/manga/93353/Koro-sensei_Q", "name": "Koro-sensei Q!"}], "member-favorites": 7071, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/52773.jpg?s=8265741868bb8a96e4d0a04e0556bca5", "link": "/anime/19759/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/75639.jpg?s=e48f2ed3c4efce6cca7ad14ed6fc587c", "link": "/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_TV", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/68547.jpg?s=b1e302c306e9b1025794c44171685b54", "link": "/anime/28405/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_TV__Deai_no_Jikan", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV): Deai no Jikan"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/77966.jpg?s=1bb482d6f64f646fac2cb1ada11a4bac", "link": "/anime/30654/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_TV_2nd_Season", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/79461.jpg?s=34cdde11e856d52a4c66057a7289a710", "link": "/anime/32863/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_TV_2nd_Season__Kagaijugyou-hen", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season: Kagaijugyou-hen"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80626.jpg?s=5567852c24849f60781fc7ab2e0cbd3a", "link": "/anime/33511/Koro-sensei_Q", "name": "Koro-sensei Q!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/84834.jpg?s=c80f7e60bc26d595fa0202f113ebaff6", "link": "/anime/33513/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu__365-nichi_no_Jikan", "name": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/83452.jpg?s=529863e62166c342a7b3c7ccf6023868", "link": "/anime/34389/Koro-sensei_Quest", "name": "Koro-sensei Quest!"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6bba\u305b\u3093\u305b\u30fc)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44649v.jpg", "link": "/people/1/Tomokazu_Seki", "name": "Seki, Tomokazu", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46269v.jpg", "link": "/people/86/Jun_Fukuyama", "name": "Fukuyama, Jun", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12539v.jpg", "link": "/people/360/Sonny_Strait", "name": "Strait, Sonny", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/2550v.jpg", "link": "/people/5927/Claus-Peter_Damitz", "name": "Damitz, Claus-Peter", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/26649/Alexandre_Coadour", "name": "Coadour, Alexandre", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/45973/Jos\u00e9_Manuel_Casany", "name": "Casany, Jos\u00e9 Manuel", "language": "Spanish"}]}
