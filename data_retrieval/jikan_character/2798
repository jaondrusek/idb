{"about": "Claus is a fifteen-year-old vanship pilot working for the Norkia Vanship Organization. His navigator is Lavie Head, with whom he shares a deep friendship since early childhood. Claus is no stranger to the vanship courier lifestyle, having been born into and raised for the lifestyle by his late father Hamilcar Valca (much like navigator George Head raised daughter Lavie). Their fathers died while attempting to cross the \"Grand Stream\" on a mission that would have brought peace to Prester.\n\n", "name": "Claus Valca", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/56456.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/86899.jpg?s=df8bf7bdd3144af253c16f3e0cf60e74", "link": "/manga/30207/Last_Exile__Sunadokei_no_Tabibito", "name": "Last Exile: Sunadokei no Tabibito"}], "member-favorites": 73, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/10888.jpg?s=84519ac4b681417631ec4188ddf5c4f8", "link": "/anime/97/Last_Exile", "name": "Last Exile"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/33541.jpg?s=c26e4725398cabb822637a27ce17b098", "link": "/anime/10336/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam", "name": "Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/34925.jpg?s=9a0fd2b3909d159d2a7d61c027d48621", "link": "/anime/12429/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam_Recaps", "name": "Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam Recaps"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ab)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49718v.jpg", "link": "/people/10/Johnny_Yong_Bosch", "name": "Bosch, Johnny Yong", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44557v.jpg", "link": "/people/400/Mayumi_Asano", "name": "Asano, Mayumi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/21671v.jpg", "link": "/people/1001/Markus_Pfeiffer", "name": "Pfeiffer, Markus", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/37187v.jpg", "link": "/people/1110/Alessio_De_Filippis", "name": "De Filippis, Alessio", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23753v.jpg", "link": "/people/8686/Micah_Solusod", "name": "Solusod, Micah", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/28505v.jpg", "link": "/people/9885/Fabien_Briche", "name": "Briche, Fabien", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15757v.jpg", "link": "/people/14829/Il_Kim", "name": "Kim, Il", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/32563v.jpg", "link": "/people/26951/Jhonny_Torres", "name": "Torres, Jhonny", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/43867/Rafael_Barioni", "name": "Barioni, Rafael", "language": "Brazilian"}]}
