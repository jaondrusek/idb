{"about": "Age: 5, 15, 25 (adult)\n Birthday: May 28\n Nationality: Japanese/Italian\n Blood type: A\n Favorite food: Grapes and Candies \n Famiglia: Vongola/Bovino\n Vongola ring: Ring of Thunder\n Box weapon: Gyuudon (Vongola Lightning Bull a.k.a. Beef Bowl)\n \n Lambo is a hitman assassin from Italy&#039;s Bovino family. He is also the self proclaimed rival of Reborn.\n \n His main choice of weapons are hand grenades and horns, and his future dream is to rule the world. Lambo dresses in a cow suit complete with a tail and has a huge afro with horns on the sides of his head which gives him the appearance of a bison. He has pretty good resistance against lightning.\n \n Although he claims to be the \"great Lambo-san,\" Lambo is a total crybaby. Because of that he occasionally uses the Ten Year Bazooka to switch places with his 10-year older alternative. But, it is seen that even 10 years older Lambo is still a complete crybaby and unable to beat Reborn. Though if he uses the 10-year bazooka again, he becomes very powerful.\n\n", "name": "Lambo ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/103074.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/32291.jpg?s=60465135abcf67b6754ef0f6152b34ef", "link": "/manga/47/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn", "name": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/26013.jpg?s=24a720f922d48d8aaff1d254819fe449", "link": "/manga/17288/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn_Secret_Bullet", "name": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!
