{"about": "Oldest daughter of the Heim family. Though Kihel is a wealthy heiress, she chooses to look for work and gain real-world experience rather than attend university. She sticks close to Guin Lineford during Dianna Counter's first attack and uses the opportunity to become his assistant. Her new position brings her to the attention of the leaders of the Moonrace.\n \n Kihel bears a striking resemblance to Dianna Soreil, which allows her to become the Queen's double. She takes Dianna's place at the Queen's behest and, due to events beyond their control, ends up having to impersonate Dianna and lead the Dianna Counter on a long-term basis. The two go on to switch names and roles several times. Kihel and Dianna share many qualities beyond appearance and their ideals are so aligned that for a time they consider themselves a single person. Even so, Kihel has much more energy than Dianna, and does not share Dianna's longing for an ordinary life. She is very good at masking her insecurity over whether or not she can live up to Dianna's example.\n \n Kihel is aware that Harry Ord is using her to draw threats away from the true Dianna. This does not stop her from falling in love with him. She permanently switches places with Dianna at the end of the series, and rules over the Moonrace with Harry at her side.\n\n", "name": "Kihel Heim", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/109147.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/27584.jpg?s=23794f721f6ec27e89b9d555caafa93e", "link": "/manga/4186/Turn_A_Gundam", "name": "Turn A Gundam"}], "member-favorites": 19, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/78330.jpg?s=c00d46b67cf757afd11070a0541be42a", "link": "/anime/95/Turn_A_Gundam", "name": "Turn A Gundam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/7121.jpg?s=6d95be18a3f551cb1699a1dbe75f039b", "link": "/anime/3963/Turn_A_Gundam_I_Movie__Earth_Light", "name": "Turn A Gundam I Movie: Earth Light"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/7122.jpg?s=6f2d2a0c710907782c10515f85ff0697", "link": "/anime/3964/Turn_A_Gundam_II_Movie__Moonlight_Butterfly", "name": "Turn A Gundam II Movie: Moonlight Butterfly"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30ad\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30e0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/31953v.jpg", "link": "/people/449/Rieko_Takahashi", "name": "Takahashi, Rieko", "language": "Japanese"}]}
