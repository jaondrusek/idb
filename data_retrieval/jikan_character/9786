{"about": "Nei is a real 10 year old girl with different colored eyes. It's a mystery how she was born due to the fact that Mars hasn't produced any children for a decade. She accompanies Layla everywhere, and is the only person or thing the stoic Layla seems to care for. Layla saw through Nei's disguise because she's been living outside the domed cities for so long, and has been living in the wild. Nei has been acting like a doll so she won't cause any trouble or attention to herself. She's been acting like a doll for so long that that it has become a part of her a little bit. Nei follows Layla because she can act like herself and not like a doll around her. She has blonde, short hair.
