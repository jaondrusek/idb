{"about": "Age: 18\n Birthdate: July 25 (Leo)\n Blood type: A\n Height: 160 cm\n Weight: 45 kg\n \n The female protagonist. Kurisu is a research member in Victor Qondria University&#039;s Brain Research Program. Her age group matches that of third-year high schoolers, but she skipped a grade through America&#039;s educational system. She is also famous in America for writing theses papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She does not want to show weakness to others, so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious, and when she builds interest, she pokes into things. Occasionally, she has views that differ from regular opinions, such as, \"The experiment data is more important than the subject&#039;s privacy.\" Rintarou often tells her, \"Hey, you&#039;ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist,\" but she is not one to agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.\n \n Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular \"Christina\" (\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ca) and \"Assistant\" (\u52a9\u624b).\n \n In the future of the Alpha world line where SERN rules, Makise worked for them. She made major contributions to the completion of SERN&#039;s time machine and was praised as \"Mother of Time Machine.\" In the side story \"The Far Valhalla,\" which explores Kurisu&#039;s, Okabe&#039;s, and Daru&#039;s fate after being captured by SERN, it&#039;s revealed that Okabe devised a plan to escape from SERN&#039;s headquarter in France, but as SERN learned that it would rule the world in the future, it let Okabe and Daru go in order to complete the cycle of fate. Kurisu gave up and stayed behind, but still believed that Okabe would be able to overcome fate. In 2034, she completed the time machine and was executed by SERN. Kurisu&#039;s allegiance with SERN in the future is the reason Suzuha, a member of the resistance against SERN&#039;s rule in 2036, is initially distrustful of her. However, Suzuha&#039;s opinion changes after she learns more about Kurisu&#039;s nature.\n \n Kurisu and her father are not on the best terms. When she was little, her father&#039;s lectures would fascinate her so much that she would read up on them herself. It was not long before she started getting into the science field. Because of her talent, she would always outsmart her own father, causing the two to come to bad terms.\n Kurisu develops feelings toward Okabe.\n (Source: naomi.thewafflehouse.net)\n\n", "name": "Kurisu Makise", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/114399.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/121341.jpg?s=b32b5faf9e172d303f2e06a291d392dd", "link": "/manga/17517/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/41878.jpg?s=082f2e8a7606b5d940aee64dcaf90e51", "link": "/manga/20699/Steins_Gate__Boukan_no_Rebellion", "name": "Steins;Gate: Boukan no Rebellion"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/150465.jpg?s=0f2f341a36103cd6c1b2e32f3dffdfa5", "link": "/manga/27965/Steins_Gate__Hiyoku_Renri_no_Sweets_Honey", "name": "Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Sweets Honey"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/46369.jpg?s=aaa7cd54b1da8ddc980befb67090a4d1", "link": "/manga/28897/Steins_Gate__Shijou_Saikyou_no_Slight_Fever", "name": "Steins;Gate: Shijou Saikyou no Slight Fever"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/72649.jpg?s=09ad3cf91fcd54a85a4cacb76986236e", "link": "/manga/39859/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/83621.jpg?s=0e4115028876a9134797a7f5845f58d6", "link": "/manga/47417/Steins_Gate__Youen_no_Valhalla", "name": "Steins;Gate: Youen no Valhalla"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/84307.jpg?s=7c91513590cfe6d1b2111e770e0bb759", "link": "/manga/47825/Steins_Gate__Aishin_Meizu_no_Babel", "name": "Steins;Gate: Aishin Meizu no Babel"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/121181.jpg?s=8cd345c7c95413bdc6d2558c4109562d", "link": "/manga/49381/Steins_Gate__Heiji_Kyokusen_no_Epigraph", "name": "Steins;Gate: Heiji Kyokusen no Epigraph"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/91575.jpg?s=b34e3e144847ed210bee8bf5e9d49955", "link": "/manga/51945/Steins_Gate__Heni_Kuukan_no_Octet", "name": "Steins;Gate: Heni Kuukan no Octet"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/175916.jpg?s=f9734bda3bd9fa29ccfece9cfbb2847d", "link": "/manga/59669/Steins_Gate__Eigou_Kaiki_no_Pandora", "name": "Steins;Gate: Eigou Kaiki no Pandora"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/108051.jpg?s=98485f7ee75fe57f47dcae174a7bc52e", "link": "/manga/62951/Gekijouban_Steins_Gate__Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D\u00e9j\u00e0_vu", "name": "Gekijouban Steins;Gate: Fuka Ryouiki no D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/129319.jpg?s=17e5b9ef6b3af605cf94adfb780f7114", "link": "/manga/74595/Steins_Gate__Hiyoku_Renri_no_Future_Honey", "name": "Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Future Honey"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/198998.jpg?s=80d1bb50c4774d607c4002e6b86d736d", "link": "/manga/107548/Steins_Gate_0", "name": "Steins;Gate 0"}], "member-favorites": 24815, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/73199.jpg?s=55684557b3d8bf741757d84d768beb29", "link": "/anime/9253/Steins_Gate", "name": "Steins;Gate"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/28921.jpg?s=4bb986d3b1569d48e642f547d3517a9a", "link": "/anime/10519/Mahou_Shoujo_Sonico\u2605Magica", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Sonico\u2605Magica"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/36531.jpg?s=c2adf71f17ff2563175268064765e747", "link": "/anime/10863/Steins_Gate__Oukoubakko_no_Poriomania", "name": "Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/50317.jpg?s=4ca635a9e67f3c25cbba115b171a4cd5", "link": "/anime/11577/Steins_Gate_Movie__Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D\u00e9j\u00e0_vu", "name": "Steins;Gate Movie: Fuka Ryouiki no D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/71319.jpg?s=f03a1484e5c49afa157bd3875781dc8f", "link": "/anime/27957/Steins_Gate__Soumei_Eichi_no_Cognitive_Computing", "name": "Steins;Gate: Soumei Eichi no Cognitive Computing"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/77633.jpg?s=e494cb89e0c9056698be3f29ed50e54e", "link": "/anime/30484/Steins_Gate_0", "name": "Steins;Gate 0"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/77324.jpg?s=1ef80202a3d120f192111b695e389cf3", "link": "/anime/32188/Steins_Gate__Kyoukaimenjou_no_Missing_Link_-_Divide_By_Zero", "name": "Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link -
